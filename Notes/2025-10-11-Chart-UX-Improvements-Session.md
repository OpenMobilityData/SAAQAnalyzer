- ✅ X-axis labels adapt intelligently to year range
- ✅ Exported PNG charts have professional, pleasing proportions
- ✅ No label clipping or text truncation
- ✅ All changes committed with descriptive messages

---

## 2. Progress Completed

### Implementation (100% Complete)

**1. Vehicle Type Display Names** (`DatabaseManager.swift`)
- ✅ Added `getVehicleTypeDisplayName()` helper function (lines 2625-2655)
- ✅ Updated three locations in `generateSeriesNameAsync()` to use descriptive names:
  - Line 2221-2225: Aggregate metrics (sum, average, min, max)
  - Line 2332-2336: Coverage metrics
  - Line 2373-2377: Count metrics
- ✅ Converts codes like "AU" → "Automobile or Light Truck"
- ✅ Matches Vehicle Class display format for consistency

**2. X-Axis Label Optimization** (`ChartView.swift`)
- ✅ Added `xAxisStride()` helper function (lines 246-273)
- ✅ Intelligent stride calculation based on year range:
  - 0-7 years: stride = 1 (show every year)
  - 8-15 years: stride = 2 (show every 2 years)
  - 16-25 years: stride = 5 (show every 5 years)
  - 26+ years: stride = 10 (show every 10 years)
- ✅ Updated `xAxisDomain()` padding from 0.5 to 1.2 years (line 244)
- ✅ Modified `.chartXAxis` to use stride (line 201)

**3. Chart Export Aspect Ratio** (`ChartView.swift`)
- ✅ Updated `exportCurrentViewAsPNG()` function (lines 408-435)
- ✅ Chart area sized at 1200×700px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- ✅ Increased chart height from 400px to 700px (75% increase)
- ✅ Fixed width at 1200px, dynamic height for legend
- ✅ Prevents vertical compression of chart visualization

### Testing (100% Complete)

**Visual Verification:**
- ✅ Chart legends show descriptive vehicle type names
- ✅ X-axis labels properly spaced for 14-year range (2011-2024)
- ✅ First and last year labels fully visible (no clipping)
- ✅ Exported PNG has professional proportions without squishing

**User Feedback:**
- ✅ "This is much better!" - confirmed proper aspect ratio
- ✅ Chart plot area no longer vertically compressed
- ✅ Legend doesn't compete with chart space

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### Architecture Decisions

**1. Descriptive Names Over Codes**
- **Decision**: Show full descriptions in legends instead of 2-character codes
- **Rationale**: Codes like "AU", "MC" require domain knowledge to understand
- **Pattern**: Matches existing Vehicle Class display format
- **Implementation**: Helper function returns description only (not "CODE - Description")

**2. Intelligent Stride Calculation**
- **Decision**: Adapt X-axis tick frequency based on data year range
- **Rationale**: Fixed stride causes either crowding (too many) or sparsity (too few)
- **Pattern**: Use switch statement with ranges optimized for SAAQ datasets
- **Trade-offs**: Optimized for common use cases (6, 12, 14 year ranges)

**3. Chart-Centric Export Sizing**
- **Decision**: Size chart area independently from legend
- **Rationale**: Legend should add space, not compress the chart
- **Pattern**: Fixed width (1200px), dynamic height based on content
- **Result**: Chart maintains 16:9 ratio, legend adds vertical space below

### Code Patterns Established

**Vehicle Type Display Helper:**
```swift
private func getVehicleTypeDisplayName(for code: String) -> String {
    switch code.uppercased() {
    case "AU": return "Automobile or Light Truck"
    case "MC": return "Motorcycle"
    // ... etc
    default: return code
    }
}
```

**Stride Calculation Pattern:**
```swift
private func xAxisStride() -> Double {
    let yearRange = maxYear - minYear
    switch yearRange {
    case 0...7: return 1
    case 8...15: return 2
    case 16...25: return 5
    default: return 10
    }
}
```

**Export Sizing Pattern:**
```swift
VStack {
    chartContent
        .frame(height: 700)  // Chart area: 16:9 ratio
    if showLegend {
        ChartLegend(...)
    }
}
.frame(width: 1200)  // Fixed width, dynamic height
```

### Configuration Values

**X-Axis Padding:**
- Old: 0.5 years
- New: 1.2 years
- Reason: Prevents label clipping at chart edges

**Chart Export Dimensions:**
- Old: 900×700 (overall), 400px chart height
- New: 1200px width, 700px chart height (16:9), dynamic total height
- Aspect ratio: ~16:9 for chart area (1200:700 ≈ 1.71:1)

**Stride Thresholds:**
- 0-7 years: Every year (e.g., 2017-2022 fuel queries)
- 8-15 years: Every 2 years (e.g., 2011-2022, 2011-2024)
- 16-25 years: Every 5 years
- 26+ years: Every 10 years

## 6. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions: ✅ NONE REQUIRED

All planned UX improvements are complete and committed. The chart visualization system is now production-ready with:
- Human-readable labels
- Intelligent axis scaling
- Professional export quality

### Optional Future Enhancements (Low Priority)

**1. Additional Export Formats (Future)**
- Enhancement: Add SVG export for vector graphics
- Use case: Academic papers, scalable publication graphics
- Priority: Low (PNG is sufficient for most use cases)

**2. Custom Aspect Ratio Settings (Nice-to-Have)**
- Enhancement: Let users choose export aspect ratio (16:9, 4:3, square)
- Location: Could add to AppSettings or export menu
- Priority: Very Low (current 16:9 works well for all cases)

**3. Export Preset Management (Optional)**
- Enhancement: Save export presets (size, quality, format)
- Pattern: Similar to chart display options (legend, grid, etc.)
- Priority: Low (current defaults are sensible)

### If Continuing Work in This Area

**To verify current implementation:**
```bash
# Test chart display
# 1. Open app in Xcode
# 2. Generate a chart with vehicle type filter
# 3. Verify legend shows descriptions (e.g., "Automobile or Light Truck")
# 4. Check X-axis labels are properly spaced
# 5. Export as PNG and verify aspect ratio

# Check git status
git status
git log --oneline -3

# View recent changes
git show HEAD
git show HEAD~1
```

**To test export quality:**
1. Generate chart with 1-2 series
2. Use "Copy Current View as PNG"
3. Paste into Preview.app (⌘N)
4. Verify chart proportions look professional
5. Check legend text is fully visible

## 7. Important Context

### Problem Analysis (From User Feedback)

**Issue 1: Cryptic Vehicle Type Codes**
- Problem: Chart legends showed "AU", "MC", etc.
- User impact: Required domain knowledge to understand
- Root cause: Series names used raw database codes

**Issue 2: Sparse X-Axis Labels**
- Problem: Default axis marks too sparse (only ~3-4 labels for 14 years)
- User impact: Difficult to contextualize data points temporally
- Root cause: SwiftUI Charts automatic tick placement

**Issue 3: Label Clipping**
- Problem: First year (2011) and last year partially cut off
- User impact: Can't read full year values at extremes
- Root cause: Insufficient axis domain padding (0.5 years)

**Issue 4: All Labels Crowded**
- Problem: Initial fix (stride=1) showed every year, causing overlap
- User impact: Labels overlapped and became illegible
- Root cause: Fixed stride doesn't adapt to data range

**Issue 5: Vertically Compressed Exports**
- Problem: Chart looked "squished" in exported PNG
- User impact: Unprofessional appearance, hard to read
- Root cause: Legend competed with chart for fixed vertical space

### Solutions Implemented

**Solution 1: Descriptive Vehicle Type Names**
```swift
// DatabaseManager.swift:2625-2655
private func getVehicleTypeDisplayName(for code: String) -> String {
    switch code.uppercased() {
    case "AU": return "Automobile or Light Truck"
    case "MC": return "Motorcycle"
    // ... full mapping
    }
}

// Applied in three locations (aggregate, coverage, count metrics)
let types = Array(filters.vehicleTypes).sorted().prefix(3).map { code in
    getVehicleTypeDisplayName(for: code)
}.joined(separator: " OR ")
```

**Solution 2: Intelligent Stride Calculation**
```swift
// ChartView.swift:246-273
private func xAxisStride() -> Double {
    let yearRange = maxYear - minYear
    switch yearRange {
    case 0...7: return 1      // 2017-2022 (6 years) → every year
    case 8...15: return 2     // 2011-2022 (12 years) → every 2 years
    case 16...25: return 5    // Extended ranges → every 5 years
    default: return 10        // Very long ranges → every 10 years
    }
}

// Applied to X-axis
.chartXAxis {
    AxisMarks(values: .stride(by: xAxisStride())) { ... }
}
```

**Solution 3: Increased Axis Padding**
```swift
// ChartView.swift:244
return (minYear - 1.2)...(maxYear + 1.2)  // Was 0.5, now 1.2
```

**Solution 4: Chart-Centric Export Sizing**
```swift
// ChartView.swift:412-432
VStack {
    chartContent
        .frame(height: 700)  // Chart: 1200×700 = 16:9 ratio
    if showLegend {
        ChartLegend(...)     // Adds vertical space below
    }
}
.frame(width: 1200)          // Fixed width, dynamic height
```

### Errors Solved

**No Compilation Errors**
- All changes compiled successfully on first try
- Swift 6.2 concurrency patterns already established
- No new dependencies added

**No Runtime Errors**
- Chart rendering works correctly
- Export functionality produces valid PNG data
- No crashes or UI glitches

### Testing Methodology

**Test Environment:**
- Dataset: Montreal subset (municipality code 66023)
- Years: 2011-2024 (14 years)
- Record count: ~10M vehicle records
- Xcode version: Latest (Swift 6.2)

**Test Cases:**
1. **Vehicle Type Legend Display**
   - Generated chart with vehicle type filter (AU, MC)
   - Verified legend shows "Automobile or Light Truck", "Motorcycle"
   - Confirmed consistency with Vehicle Class format

2. **X-Axis Label Spacing**
   - Tested with 14-year range (2011-2024)
   - Verified stride = 2 (shows 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2023)
   - Confirmed no label overlap or clipping

3. **Chart Export Aspect Ratio**
   - Exported chart with single series
   - Pasted into Preview.app
   - Verified chart area looks properly proportioned (not squished)
   - Confirmed legend text fully visible

### User Feedback Integration

**Session Flow:**
1. User: "Vehicle type codes are cryptic" → Added descriptive names
2. User: "X-axis labels too sparse" → Added stride calculation
3. User: "Too many labels now, clipping" → Made stride intelligent
4. User: "First/last years clipped" → Increased padding
5. User: "Export looks squished" → Fixed aspect ratio
6. User: "Still a bit squished (legend competes)" → Made height dynamic
7. User: "This is much better!" → ✅ Success

### Dependencies & Requirements

**No New Dependencies:**
- Uses existing SwiftUI Charts framework
- Uses existing SQLite3
- No external packages added

**Minimum Requirements:**
- macOS 13.0+ (for NavigationSplitView and Charts)
- Swift 6.2 (for modern concurrency)
- Xcode 15+ (for Swift 6 support)

### Known Limitations

**1. Fixed Stride Thresholds**
- Stride calculation uses hardcoded thresholds
- Works well for SAAQ datasets (6-14 year ranges)
- May need adjustment for very different use cases
- Future: Could make thresholds configurable

**2. Export Scale Factor**
- Uses `AppSettings.shared.exportScaleFactor`
- Default scale factor not modified in this session
- Assumed to be 2x or 3x for Retina displays
- Location: `AppSettings.swift` (not modified)

**3. Legend Size Estimation**
- Export height adjusts dynamically but unpredictably
- SwiftUI calculates legend height at render time
- No pre-calculation of exact bitmap dimensions
- Result: Varies based on series count and name length
