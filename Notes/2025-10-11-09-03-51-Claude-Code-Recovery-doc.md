# Claude Code Session Recovery Document

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Time**: Session interrupted ~8:54 AM  
**Branch**: `rhoge-dev`  
**Project**: SAAQAnalyzer  
**Issue**: iTerm2 paste cancellation caused terminal hang during Claude Code session

---

## Session Context

### What We Were Working On
- **Primary Task**: Implementing query optimization for slow regularization queries
- **Specific Focus**: Preparing to test with Montreal-only data subset (~10M records vs 77M full dataset)
- **Phase**: Analysis complete, ready to implement materialized table solution

### Session State at Interruption
- **Code Changes**: ‚úÖ NONE (confirmed via git status - no modifications)
- **Analysis Complete**: Root cause identified (query structure, not missing indexes)
- **Next Action Blocked On**: User needed to prepare Montreal-only CSV files for testing

---

## Terminal Incident Details

### What Happened
1. Claude Code requested Xcode console output to analyze performance
2. User attempted to paste thousands of lines of console output into prompt
3. iTerm2 showed progress indicator warning of long paste duration
4. User clicked 'Cancel' on iTerm2's paste progress panel
5. Terminal became unresponsive to standard interrupts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, Esc)
6. Process 44999 (claude) was in sleeping state waiting for input
7. Session terminated with `kill -INT 44999`

### Terminal State
```bash
# Process status before termination
PID: 44999
State: S+ (sleeping in foreground, waiting for input)
CPU: 0.21.02 (minimal activity)
Terminal: s000 (iTerm2)
```

---

## Work Completed in Session

### 1. Confirmed Database Analysis
- ‚úÖ Verified all 30+ indexes exist and are properly created
- ‚úÖ Confirmed query structure is the bottleneck (not missing indexes)
- ‚úÖ Identified that queries scan 54M rows with expensive GROUP BY operations

### 2. Testing Strategy Defined
- ‚úÖ Decided to use Montreal subset for rapid iteration
- ‚úÖ Prepared extraction commands for Montreal-only CSVs
- ‚úÖ Estimated ~10M records would provide good test case

### 3. Optimization Approach Selected
- ‚úÖ Chose materialized summary table as primary strategy
- ‚úÖ Identified `canonical_hierarchy_cache` table design
- ‚úÖ Planned incremental aggregation as backup approach

---

## Critical Information to Preserve

### Performance Baselines (77M Records)
```
üêå Canonical Hierarchy Generation: 146.675s (target: <10s)
‚ö†Ô∏è Find Uncurated Pairs: 22.243s (target: <5s)
Total UI blocking: ~180 seconds
```

### Key Files Analyzed (No Modifications)
1. `RegularizationManager.swift` - Lines 113-137 contain slow query
2. `DatabaseManager.swift` - Lines 827-890 show existing indexes
3. `CategoricalEnumManager.swift` - Lines 56-87 create enum indexes
4. `RegularizationView.swift` - Has UI performance optimizations

### Database Location
```bash
./com.endoquant.SAAQAnalyzer/Data/Documents/saaq_data.sqlite
```

---

## Recovery Steps for New Session

### 1. Verify Project State
```bash
cd /Users/rhoge/Desktop/SAAQAnalyzer
git status  # Should show no changes
git log --oneline -1  # Verify on rhoge-dev branch
```

### 2. Check Database Status
```bash
# Check if database still exists (77M records)
ls -lh ./com.endoquant.SAAQAnalyzer/Data/Documents/saaq_data.sqlite

# Verify record count
sqlite3 ./com.endoquant.SAAQAnalyzer/Data/Documents/saaq_data.sqlite \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles;"
```

### 3. Resume Where Left Off
The session was preparing to:
1. Delete existing database
2. Create Montreal-only CSV files
3. Import Montreal subset
4. Implement materialized table optimization

### 4. Montreal CSV Extraction (If Not Done)
```bash
# Extract Montreal records (municipality code 66023)
for year in {2011..2024}; do
  head -1 "Vehicule_En_Circulation_${year}.csv" > "Montreal_${year}.csv"
  grep "^${year},[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,66023," \
    "Vehicule_En_Circulation_${year}.csv" >> "Montreal_${year}.csv"
done
```

---

## Console Output Handling Strategy

### For Future Large Pastes
Instead of pasting thousands of lines directly:

1. **Save to file first**:
```bash
# Save Xcode console output to file
pbpaste > console_output.txt
```

2. **Extract relevant portions**:
```bash
# Get performance-related lines
grep -E "query:|points|Slow|Complete" console_output.txt > performance_summary.txt
```

3. **Reference in Claude Code**:
```
"Console output saved to console_output.txt. Key performance metrics:
[paste only the summary lines]"
```

---

## Implementation Plan (Ready to Execute)

### Phase 1: Materialized Table Implementation
```sql
-- Create cache table
CREATE TABLE canonical_hierarchy_cache (
    make_id INTEGER,
    make_name TEXT,
    model_id INTEGER,
    model_name TEXT,
    model_year_id INTEGER,
    model_year INTEGER,
    fuel_type_id INTEGER,
    fuel_type_code TEXT,
    fuel_type_desc TEXT,
    vehicle_type_id INTEGER,
    vehicle_type_code TEXT,
    vehicle_type_desc TEXT,
    record_count INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (make_id, model_id, model_year_id, fuel_type_id, vehicle_type_id)
);

-- Populate during import (incremental)
-- Query cache instead of vehicles table
```

### Phase 2: Query Rewrite
- Replace 6-way JOIN with simple cache query
- Expected performance: <1 second (vs 146s)

### Phase 3: Test and Validate
- Test with Montreal data first
- Verify performance improvement
- Scale to full dataset

## Session Recovery Checklist

- [ ] Start new Claude Code session
- [ ] Navigate to project directory
- [ ] Verify git status (no changes)
- [ ] Check database status
- [ ] Decide: Continue with 77M dataset or switch to Montreal subset
- [ ] If Montreal: Create subset CSVs
- [ ] Implement materialized table solution
- [ ] Test performance improvements
- [ ] Commit changes when verified

---

## Context for Claude Code

When starting new session, provide:
1. This recovery document
2. The original handoff document (already attached)
3. Brief statement: "Continuing query optimization work. Session was interrupted during console paste. No code changes made. Ready to implement materialized table solution."

---

## Notes

- **Token Usage**: Previous session used ~142k/200k tokens
- **No Code Loss**: Git confirms no modifications were made
- **Terminal Recovery**: Successfully used `kill -INT` to end hung process
- **Lesson Learned**: Always save large outputs to files before sharing in Claude Code

---

**Status**: Ready to resume implementation in new Claude Code session
