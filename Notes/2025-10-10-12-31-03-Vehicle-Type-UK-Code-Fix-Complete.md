# Vehicle Type UNK ‚Üí UK Code Fix - Session Complete

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and committed
**Branch**: `rhoge-dev`
**Commit**: `f69ffe6`

## 1. Current Task & Objective

### Primary Goal
Fix the misuse of vehicle type codes in the regularization system to ensure consistency with the two-character pattern used by all other vehicle type codes in the SAAQ data.

### Problems Addressed
1. **Three-character "UNK" code**: The regularization UI was using a three-character code "UNK" for Unknown vehicle types, breaking the pattern of two-character codes (AB, AT, AU, CA, CY, HM, MC, MN, NV, SN, VO, VT)
2. **AT code misuse**: The code "AT" (which means "Dealer Plates" in the actual SAAQ data) was being mapped to "Unknown" in the CSV import logic, causing data integrity issues
3. **Inconsistent UI display**: The Unknown vehicle type was not displaying with the " - Unknown" suffix pattern used by Vehicle Class
4. **Wrong list position**: The Unknown option was appearing mid-list instead of at the end like Vehicle Class Unknown

### Design Philosophy
**Consistency across enum types**: All "Unknown" enum values should follow appropriate patterns:
- **Fuel Type**: Code "U" for Unknown (1 character, matches fuel type pattern)
- **Vehicle Class**: Code "UNK" for Unknown (3 characters, matches vehicle class pattern)
- **Vehicle Type**: Code "UK" for Unknown (2 characters, matches vehicle type pattern) ‚Üê **THIS FIX**

## 2. Progress Completed

### ‚úÖ All Changes Implemented and Committed

#### Phase 1: Database Enum Value Fix
**File**: `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/DatabaseManager.swift`
- **Line 962**: Changed enum insertion from `'UNK'` to `'UK'`
- **Purpose**: Creates vehicle_type_enum table with correct two-character Unknown value

#### Phase 2: Restore AT Code Meaning
**File**: `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/DatabaseManager.swift`
- **Line 4541**: Changed AT description from "Unknown" to "Dealer Plates"
- **Purpose**: Restores correct meaning for AT code in CSV import logic

#### Phase 3: Regularization UI Fixes
**File**: `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/RegularizationView.swift`
- **Line 486**: Changed UI picker code from `"UNK"` to `"UK"` with display text "UK - Unknown"
- **Line 1352**: Changed load logic code from `"UNK"` to `"UK"`
- **Purpose**: Ensures regularization mapping UI uses correct two-character code

#### Phase 4: Filter Panel UI Fixes
**File**: `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/FilterPanel.swift`
- **Lines 1264-1272**: Added custom sort logic to place UK at end of vehicle type list
- **Line 1368**: Changed special case check from `"AT"` to `"UK"`
- **Lines 1376, 1396**: Restored AT to "Dealer Plates" description and tooltip
- **Line 1405**: Added UK tooltip "Unknown (user-assigned)"
- **Purpose**: Vehicle type filter display with correct formatting and ordering

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### Architectural Pattern: Enum Code Consistency

Each enum type in the system uses a consistent code length pattern:

| Enum Type | Code Length | Unknown Code | Example Real Codes |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Fuel Type | 1 char | "U" | E, D, H, G |
| Vehicle Class | 3 chars | "UNK" | PAU, CAU, PMC, BCA |
| Vehicle Type | 2 chars | "UK" | AB, AT, AU, CA, MC |

**Key Insight**: The code length should match the pattern used by real data values in that field, not be arbitrarily chosen.

### Database Creation Pattern

The application creates enum tables and populates special values during initialization:

**Location**: `DatabaseManager.createTablesIfNeeded()` (lines 956-963)

```swift
// Insert special "Unknown" values for regularization system
print("üîß Inserting special 'Unknown' enum values for regularization...")
let unknownInserts = [
    "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO fuel_type_enum (code, description) VALUES ('U', 'Unknown');",
    "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO vehicle_class_enum (code, description) VALUES ('UNK', 'Unknown');",
    "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO vehicle_type_enum (code, description) VALUES ('UK', 'Unknown');"  // ‚Üê FIXED
]
```

**Important Notes**:
- `INSERT OR IGNORE` prevents duplicates on re-runs
- These values never appear in source CSV data
- Created specifically for user-driven regularization workflow
- Database is ephemeral - deleted and recreated when container is purged

### UI Display Pattern

The filter panel uses a consistent display pattern for all enum types:

```
CODE - Description
```

Examples:
- Vehicle Class: `UNK - Unknown` (appears at end of list)
- Vehicle Type: `UK - Unknown` (appears at end of list) ‚Üê **NOW FIXED**
- Vehicle Type: `AT - Dealer Plates` (appears alphabetically) ‚Üê **RESTORED**

### Custom Sorting for Special Values

To place "Unknown" values at the end of filter lists (matching user expectations), we implement custom sorting:

```swift
private var displayedItems: [String] {
    let sorted = filteredItems.sorted { item1, item2 in
        // If either is UK, put it at the end
        if item1.uppercased() == "UK" { return false }
        if item2.uppercased() == "UK" { return true }
        // Otherwise sort alphabetically
        return item1 < item2
    }
    return isExpanded ? sorted : Array(sorted.prefix(6))
}
```

This ensures UK appears after VT (the last alphabetical vehicle type code).

### UI Placeholder Pattern

The regularization UI uses placeholder ID `-1` for "Unknown" options:

1. **UI displays option** with `id: -1, code: "UK"`
2. **User selects** "Unknown"
3. **Save logic** detects `id == -1`
4. **Save logic** looks up actual ID from enum table using code "UK"
5. **Save logic** saves resolved ID to database

This pattern is used for both Vehicle Type and Fuel Type "Unknown" values.

## 6. Next Steps (Priority Order)

### üü¢ OPTIONAL - Push to Remote

If desired, push the committed changes to remote:
```bash
git push origin rhoge-dev
```

### üü¢ OPTIONAL - Update Session Notes Index

Consider adding this session note to the master index if one exists in the Notes directory.

### üîµ FUTURE - Database Maintenance Note

**Important**: The next time the user deletes their app container (which triggers database recreation), the new UK enum value will be created automatically. No manual migration is needed because:

1. Database is ephemeral (deleted and recreated regularly)
2. createTablesIfNeeded() runs on every app launch
3. INSERT OR IGNORE ensures UK value is added without errors
4. Old UNK values (if any existed) will be orphaned but harmless

**If old mappings with UNK exist**: They will have IDs that don't match the new UK enum ID, but since the database gets recreated frequently in development, this is not a concern. In production, these would need to be migrated, but this is a development-only tool.

---

## 7. Important Context

### How This Issue Was Discovered

During code review, user noticed that the vehicle type filter was using "UNK" (3 characters) which didn't match the two-character pattern of all other vehicle type codes in the SAAQ data.

**User observation**:
> "The code UNK for vehicle type does not conform to the pattern for other codes in this field, which use two-character codes"

### Root Cause Analysis

The original implementation likely:
1. Copied the "UNK" pattern from Vehicle Class without considering code length differences
2. Didn't realize AT was a real vehicle type code (Dealer Plates)
3. Used AT as a placeholder for Unknown in multiple places

### Why Two Characters for Vehicle Type

**SAAQ Data Pattern**: All vehicle type codes in the actual CSV data are exactly 2 characters:
- AB (Bus)
- AT (Dealer Plates)
- AU (Automobile or Light Truck)
- CA (Truck or Road Tractor)
- CY (Moped)
- HM (Motorhome)
- MC (Motorcycle)
- MN (Snowmobile)
- NV (Other Off-Road Vehicle)
- SN (Snow Blower)
- VO (Tool Vehicle)
- VT (All-Terrain Vehicle)

The Unknown code should match this pattern: **UK** (2 characters).

### AT Code - Real Meaning

**AT = Dealer Plates** (Auto/Temporary):
- Legitimate vehicle type in SAAQ data
- Used for vehicles with dealer/temporary registration
- Exists in canonical database (curated years 2011-2022)
- Should NOT be overloaded to mean "Unknown"

**Evidence**: The DatabaseManager.swift switch statement at line 4539 shows AT is a distinct vehicle type alongside others, not a special sentinel value.

### Database Recreation Workflow

**User's Development Pattern** (from CLAUDE.md):
- Database is treated as an **ephemeral artifact** for persistence and performance
- When making schema or enum changes, user **purges entire Container**
- App logic regenerates tables with correct structure on next launch
- **No database migrations** - clean slate approach

**Command to delete container**:
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.endoquant.SAAQAnalyzer
```

**Implication**: No need for ALTER TABLE or UPDATE statements. Just fix the INSERT statement and recreate database.

### Save Logic Reference

The save logic in `RegularizationView.saveMapping()` (lines 889-903) handles placeholder ID resolution:

```swift
if let vehicleType = selectedVehicleType, vehicleType.id == -1 {
    print("üîç Resolving placeholder VehicleType ID -1 (code: \(vehicleType.code))")
    let enumManager = CategoricalEnumManager(databaseManager: databaseManager)
    if let resolvedId = try await enumManager.getEnumId(
        table: "vehicle_type_enum",
        column: "code",
        value: vehicleType.code  // Now uses "UK" instead of "UNK"
    ) {
        vehicleTypeId = resolvedId
        print("‚úÖ Resolved VehicleType '\(vehicleType.code)' to ID \(resolvedId)")
    }
}
```

**Key Point**: This code doesn't need changes - it already uses the `code` value from the VehicleTypeInfo struct, which now correctly contains "UK".

### Consistency with Existing Patterns

The fix follows established patterns from other enum types:

**Vehicle Class** (already correct):
- Picker: `code: "UNK"` (3 chars)
- Database: `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO vehicle_class_enum (code, description) VALUES ('UNK', 'Unknown');`
- Display: "UNK - Unknown" at end of list

**Fuel Type** (already correct):
- Picker: `code: "U"` (1 char)
- Database: `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO fuel_type_enum (code, description) VALUES ('U', 'Unknown');`
- Display: Uses standard fuel type enum (U is in the data)

**Vehicle Type** (NOW fixed):
- Picker: `code: "UK"` (2 chars) - was "UNK", now fixed
- Database: `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO vehicle_type_enum (code, description) VALUES ('UK', 'Unknown');`
- Display: "UK - Unknown" at end of list

## 12. Summary for Handoff

### What Changed
Fixed vehicle type Unknown code from three-character "UNK" to two-character "UK" to match the pattern used by all other vehicle type codes in SAAQ data. Restored "AT" to its correct meaning ("Dealer Plates") instead of misusing it for "Unknown". Updated all UI displays to show "UK - Unknown" at the end of vehicle type lists with proper formatting.

### What's Complete
All code changes implemented, tested, and committed. Changes staged on branch `rhoge-dev` (commit f69ffe6). User verified all functionality works correctly in running application.

### What's Ready
Ready to push to remote if desired. No further changes needed. Database will automatically use correct UK enum value on next recreation (which happens naturally during development workflow).

### Files Modified
- `DatabaseManager.swift`: 2 changes (enum insert + AT description)
- `RegularizationView.swift`: 2 changes (picker + load logic)
- `FilterPanel.swift`: 5 changes (sort + display + tooltips)

### Dependencies
- Requires database recreation for UK enum value (happens naturally via container deletion)
- No migration logic needed (clean slate approach)
- No changes to save logic (already uses code from struct)
- No breaking changes (old UNK values would be orphaned but database gets recreated regularly)

### Success Criteria Met
‚úÖ Two-character code pattern maintained
‚úÖ AT restored to correct meaning
‚úÖ UI displays with proper formatting
‚úÖ Unknown appears at end of list
‚úÖ All tests passing
‚úÖ User verified functionality
