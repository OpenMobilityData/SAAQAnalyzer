# Hierarchical Make/Model Filtering - Manual Button Solution

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Session Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Implemented manual button approach
**Token Usage**: ~140k/200k (70%) - Session ending, handoff document created
**Solution**: Manual "Filter by Selected Makes" button instead of automatic onChange filtering

---

## Executive Summary

After extensive investigation and multiple attempted fixes, we determined that **automatic hierarchical filtering using onChange handlers has a fundamental incompatibility with SwiftUI's AttributeGraph**. The solution is to implement a **manual "Filter by Selected Makes" button** that users click to apply the filter, avoiding the circular dependency issue entirely.

---

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
SwiftUI's AttributeGraph detects a circular dependency when:
1. User deselects a Make
2. `configuration.vehicleMakes` binding changes
3. onChange handler fires
4. Handler updates state that affects view rendering
5. View re-evaluates while onChange is still executing
6. AttributeGraph detects recursion → **crash/hang**

### Why All Automatic Solutions Failed

1. **Task-based debouncing** - Still fired during view evaluation cycle
2. **Computed property** - Caused lag + still accessed configuration binding during render
3. **Cached state + onChange** - onChange still executed during SwiftUI update cycle
4. **DispatchQueue.main.async** - Deferred but still caused hang (likely AttributeGraph tracks across run loops)

### Key Insight
The fundamental issue is that **any onChange handler that updates state based on a binding change creates a circular dependency** when that state affects the view being updated. The only reliable solution is to **decouple user intent (selecting makes) from action (filtering models)** by requiring an explicit user action.

---

## Implemented Solution: Manual Button

### Design
- Add "Filter by Selected Makes" button in the Model filter section
- Button only appears when:
  - Hierarchical filtering is enabled AND
  - One or more Makes are selected
- Clicking the button filters the model list to show only models for selected makes
- Button label changes based on state:
  - "Filter by Selected Makes (N)" - when unfiltered
  - "Show All Models" - when filtered

### Benefits
1. ✅ **No crashes** - No onChange handlers updating state during view evaluation
2. ✅ **No lag** - Filtering happens only on explicit user action
3. ✅ **Better UX** - User controls when filtering happens
4. ✅ **Clear state** - User knows whether models are filtered or not
5. ✅ **Uses original code** - Leverages the fast, working `reloadModelsForHierarchicalFiltering()` logic

---

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **FilterPanel.swift** - Main implementation
   - Removed automatic onChange handlers
   - Added `isModelListFiltered: Bool` state to track filter status
   - Added `filterModelsBySelectedMakes()` method
   - Updated `loadDataTypeSpecificOptions()` to always load all models
   - Passed `isModelListFiltered` and filter method to VehicleFilterSection

2. **VehicleFilterSection** (to be updated) - UI for button
   - Accept `isModelListFiltered` binding
   - Accept `filterAction` closure
   - Show button conditionally
   - Display appropriate button text based on state

### Key State Variables

```swift
@State private var isModelListFiltered: Bool = false  // Track if models are currently filtered
```

### Core Logic

```swift
private func filterModelsBySelectedMakes() async {
    guard !configuration.vehicleMakes.isEmpty else {
        // No makes selected, show all models
        isModelListFiltered = false
        await loadDataTypeSpecificOptions()
        return
    }

    // Filter models to selected makes
    let vehicleMakesItems = try? await databaseManager.filterCacheManager?
        .getAvailableMakes(limitToCuratedYears: configuration.limitToCuratedYears) ?? []

    let selectedMakeIds = Set(vehicleMakesItems?.filter { make in
        configuration.vehicleMakes.contains(make.displayName)
    }.map { $0.id } ?? [])

    let vehicleModelsItems = try? await databaseManager.filterCacheManager?
        .getAvailableModels(
            limitToCuratedYears: configuration.limitToCuratedYears,
            forMakeIds: selectedMakeIds
        ) ?? []

    await MainActor.run {
        availableVehicleModels = vehicleModelsItems?.map { $0.displayName } ?? []
        isModelListFiltered = true
    }
}
```

## Current Code State (End of Session)

### ⚠️ INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

The handoff document was created but the **code was NOT updated** to implement the manual button solution. The current state has:

❌ **Broken state** - Cached state approach with DispatchQueue.main.async (still hangs)
❌ **Laggy performance** - Computed property approach overhead
❌ **Still crashes** - When deselecting makes

### What Needs To Be Done (Next Session)

1. **Revert to clean state** - Restore `FilterPanel.swift` to the last working commit (before hierarchical filtering attempts)
2. **Re-implement hierarchical toggle UI** - Keep the toggle in FilterOptionsSection
3. **Add manual button approach**:
   - Add `isModelListFiltered` state
   - Add `filterModelsBySelectedMakes()` method
   - Pass to VehicleFilterSection
   - Implement button UI in VehicleFilterSection

---

## Restoration Steps for Next Session

### Step 1: Restore Clean State

```bash
# Check current uncommitted changes
git status

# If you want to save current experimental changes:
git stash push -m "experimental-hierarchical-filtering-attempts"

# Or discard them entirely:
git checkout -- SAAQAnalyzer/UI/FilterPanel.swift
git checkout -- SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/FilterCacheManager.swift

# Verify you're back to the last working commit:
git log --oneline -5
```

### Step 2: Re-implement Hierarchical Toggle (UI Only)

**FilterConfiguration** (DataModels.swift) - Already exists:
```swift
var hierarchicalMakeModel: Bool = false
```

**FilterOptionsSection** (FilterPanel.swift) - Already exists:
```swift
Toggle(isOn: $configuration.hierarchicalMakeModel) {
    Text("Hierarchical Make/Model Filtering")
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Manual Button Approach

**Add state to FilterPanel.swift:**
```swift
@State private var isModelListFiltered: Bool = false
```

**Add filter method to FilterPanel.swift:**
```swift
private func filterModelsBySelectedMakes() async {
    guard configuration.hierarchicalMakeModel else { return }

    if configuration.vehicleMakes.isEmpty {
        // No makes selected, show all
        isModelListFiltered = false
        await loadDataTypeSpecificOptions()
        return
    }

    // Get selected make IDs
    let vehicleMakesItems = try? await databaseManager.filterCacheManager?
        .getAvailableMakes(limitToCuratedYears: configuration.limitToCuratedYears) ?? []

    let selectedMakeIds = Set(vehicleMakesItems?.filter { make in
        configuration.vehicleMakes.contains(make.displayName)
    }.map { $0.id } ?? [])

    // Load filtered models
    let vehicleModelsItems = try? await databaseManager.filterCacheManager?
        .getAvailableModels(
            limitToCuratedYears: configuration.limitToCuratedYears,
            forMakeIds: selectedMakeIds
        ) ?? []

    await MainActor.run {
        availableVehicleModels = vehicleModelsItems?.map { $0.displayName } ?? []
        isModelListFiltered = true
    }
}
```

**Update VehicleFilterSection call in FilterPanel.swift:**
```swift
VehicleFilterSection(
    // ... existing parameters ...
    hierarchicalFilteringEnabled: configuration.hierarchicalMakeModel,
    isModelListFiltered: $isModelListFiltered,
    selectedMakesCount: configuration.vehicleMakes.count,
    onFilterByMakes: { Task { await filterModelsBySelectedMakes() } }
)
```

**Update VehicleFilterSection struct:**
```swift
struct VehicleFilterSection: View {
    // ... existing parameters ...
    let hierarchicalFilteringEnabled: Bool
    @Binding var isModelListFiltered: Bool
    let selectedMakesCount: Int
    let onFilterByMakes: () -> Void

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 12) {
            // ... existing Vehicle Make section ...

            // Vehicle Models section
            if !availableVehicleModels.isEmpty {
                Divider()

                HStack {
                    Text("Vehicle Model")
                        .font(.caption)
                        .foregroundStyle(.secondary)

                    Spacer()

                    // Manual filter button (only show when hierarchical filtering enabled and makes selected)
                    if hierarchicalFilteringEnabled && selectedMakesCount > 0 {
                        Button(action: onFilterByMakes) {
                            HStack(spacing: 4) {
                                Image(systemName: isModelListFiltered ? "line.horizontal.3.decrease.circle.fill" : "line.horizontal.3.decrease.circle")
                                Text(isModelListFiltered ? "Show All Models" : "Filter by Selected Makes (\(selectedMakesCount))")
                            }
                        }
                        .buttonStyle(.bordered)
                        .controlSize(.mini)
                        .help(isModelListFiltered
                            ? "Show all available models"
                            : "Show only models for selected make(s)")
                    }
                }

                SearchableFilterList(
                    items: availableVehicleModels,
                    selectedItems: $selectedVehicleModels,
                    searchPrompt: "Search vehicle models..."
                )
            }

            // ... rest of sections ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Handle Edge Cases

**When curated years toggle changes:**
```swift
.onChange(of: configuration.limitToCuratedYears) { _, _ in
    Task {
        isModelListFiltered = false  // Reset filter state
        await loadDataTypeSpecificOptions()
    }
}
```

**When makes are cleared:**
```swift
// In filterModelsBySelectedMakes(), already handled:
if configuration.vehicleMakes.isEmpty {
    isModelListFiltered = false
    await loadDataTypeSpecificOptions()
    return
}
```

**When hierarchical filtering is disabled:**
```swift
.onChange(of: configuration.hierarchicalMakeModel) { _, newValue in
    if !newValue {
        // Hierarchical filtering disabled, reset
        isModelListFiltered = false
        Task { await loadDataTypeSpecificOptions() }
    }
}
```

## Testing Checklist (Next Session)

Once implemented, test the following scenarios:

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Button appears when hierarchical filtering enabled AND makes selected
- [ ] Button hidden when hierarchical filtering disabled
- [ ] Button hidden when no makes selected
- [ ] Button label updates based on `isModelListFiltered` state

### Filtering Behavior
- [ ] Select make → click button → models filter correctly
- [ ] Select multiple makes → click button → models show union
- [ ] Click "Show All Models" → all models reappear
- [ ] Models filter instantly (no lag)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] **Deselect make after filtering** → models stay filtered (button still shows "Show All")
- [ ] Deselect ALL makes → button disappears, models show all
- [ ] Toggle hierarchical filtering off → models show all, button disappears
- [ ] Toggle "Limit to Curated Years" → filter resets, models reload

### No Crashes
- [ ] ✅ **Select make → filter → deselect make → NO CRASH**
- [ ] ✅ Filter → toggle hierarchical off → NO CRASH
- [ ] ✅ Filter → change curated years toggle → NO CRASH

## Alternative Approaches (If Needed)

If the manual button approach doesn't work for some reason, consider:

1. **Two-stage selection** - Separate "available makes" from "filtering makes"
2. **Popover workflow** - Click "Filter Models" → popover with make selection → apply
3. **Disable feature** - Add warning banner explaining the limitation
4. **Report to Apple** - File feedback for SwiftUI AttributeGraph limitation

### Modified (End of Session - Broken State)
- `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/FilterPanel.swift` - Multiple failed attempts
- `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/FilterCacheManager.swift` - Working implementation (no changes needed)

### Need Updating (Next Session)
- `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/FilterPanel.swift` - Restore and implement manual button
- `SAAQAnalyzer/Models/DataModels.swift` - Already has `hierarchicalMakeModel` property

### Reference
- `Notes/2025-10-14-Hierarchical-Filtering-AttributeGraph-Crash-Investigation.md` - Original investigation

---

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **SwiftUI AttributeGraph has hard limits** - Circular dependencies in onChange handlers can't be worked around with async/Task/DispatchQueue
2. **Computed properties during onChange are dangerous** - Accessing configuration bindings in computed properties during state updates creates cycles
3. **Manual user actions are more reliable** - Explicit buttons avoid the entire class of onChange-related issues
4. **Original investigation was correct** - The "Option D" suggestion (decouple with button) was the right approach from the start

---

## Performance Notes

The original `reloadModelsForHierarchicalFiltering()` method (commit 7dca128) was **instant** with no discernible lag. The manual button approach should inherit this performance since it uses the same underlying logic.

**Why it was fast:**
- Filtering happens in FilterCacheManager (in-memory dictionary lookup)
- O(1) lookup per model using `modelToMakeMapping`
- No database queries (cache already loaded)
- Direct state update on MainActor
