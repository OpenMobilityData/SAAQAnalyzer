# Unknown Field Value Implementation - Session Summary
**Date:** October 8, 2025 (Evening Session - Part 3)
**Session Focus:** Implementing "Unknown" enum value to distinguish unreviewed fields from explicitly unknowable fields

---

## 1. Current Task & Objective

**Overall Goal:** Implement an "Unknown" enum value for FuelType and VehicleType fields in the regularization system to distinguish between:
- **NULL (unreviewed)**: Fields that haven't been reviewed yet ‚Üí Orange "Needs Review" badge
- **"Unknown" (reviewed but unknowable)**: Fields explicitly marked as unknowable by user ‚Üí Green "Complete" badge

**Problem Statement:** Without this distinction, the orange "Partial" badge was ambiguous - it could mean either "not reviewed" OR "reviewed but couldn't disambiguate". Users had no way to track which pairs had been reviewed.

**Solution:** Add "Unknown" as an explicit enum value in `fuel_type_enum` and `classification_enum` tables, allowing users to explicitly mark fields as unknowable.

---

## 2. Progress Completed

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Database Schema Updates
**File:** `CategoricalEnumManager.swift`

Added "Unknown" enum values that will be inserted during database initialization:
- `fuel_type_enum`: Added `("U", "Unknown")` at line 365
- `classification_enum`: Added `("UNK", "Unknown")` at line 276

**Also fixed HMN code mismatch:**
- Changed HMN from incorrect "Other/Unknown classification" to correct "Off-road snowmobile"
- Added missing classification codes: HAB, HCA, HVT, HVO (all off-road categories)
- All codes now match Vehicle-Registration-Schema.md exactly

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Badge System Updates (3 Colors)
**File:** `RegularizationView.swift`

**Updated `RegularizationStatus` enum (lines 277-281):**
```swift
case none              // üî¥ No mapping exists
case needsReview       // üü† Mapping exists but fields are NULL
case fullyRegularized  // üü¢ Both fields assigned (including "Unknown")
```

**Badge UI updates:**
- Line 249: "Unassigned" (red)
- Line 257: "Needs Review" (orange) - was "Partial"
- Line 265: "Complete" (green)

**Badge logic (lines 891-908):**
- Green badge appears when BOTH FuelType AND VehicleType are non-NULL
- "Unknown" counts as assigned (user made explicit decision)
- Orange badge appears when EITHER field is NULL (needs review)

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: UI Picker Updates
**File:** `RegularizationView.swift`

**Three picker options now available:**
1. **"Not Specified"** (first option) ‚Üí Sets NULL, triggers orange badge
2. **"Unknown"** (second option) ‚Üí Sets "Unknown" enum value, triggers green badge
3. **Actual types** (remaining options) ‚Üí Sets specific type, triggers green badge

**Implementation (lines 442-461 for VehicleType, 490-509 for FuelType):**
- Added "Unknown" option with placeholder ID `-1`
- Picker creates special instance: `MakeModelHierarchy.VehicleTypeInfo(id: -1, code: "UNK", description: "Unknown", recordCount: 0)`
- Similar for FuelType with code "U"

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Save Mapping Logic
**File:** `RegularizationView.swift` (lines 719-767)

**Placeholder ID resolution:**
When user selects "Unknown" (ID `-1`), the save function:
1. Detects placeholder ID `-1`
2. Creates `CategoricalEnumManager` instance
3. Looks up real ID from database using code ("U" or "UNK")
4. Saves mapping with real ID

```swift
if let fuelType = selectedFuelType, fuelType.id == -1 {
    let enumManager = CategoricalEnumManager(databaseManager: databaseManager)
    fuelTypeId = try await enumManager.getEnumId(
        table: "fuel_type_enum",
        column: "code",
        value: fuelType.code  // "U"
    )
}
```

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: Load Mapping Logic Fix
**File:** `RegularizationView.swift` (lines 967-1000)

**Critical fix for picker binding:**
When loading a saved mapping with "Unknown" values, the code now:
1. Checks if `mapping.fuelType == "Unknown"`
2. Creates matching instance with ID `-1` (same as picker option)
3. Binds to picker correctly

**Without this fix:** "Unknown" values reverted to "Not Specified" after save because SwiftUI couldn't match the instance.

```swift
if let mapping = mapping, let fuelTypeName = mapping.fuelType {
    if fuelTypeName == "Unknown" {
        selectedFuelType = MakeModelHierarchy.FuelTypeInfo(
            id: -1, code: "U", description: "Unknown", recordCount: 0
        )
    } else {
        selectedFuelType = model.fuelTypes.first { $0.description == fuelTypeName }
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Phase 6: Auto-Assignment Logic Update
**File:** `RegularizationView.swift` (lines 832-843)

**Reverted unnecessary "Unknown" filtering:**
- Originally added filtering for "unknown"/"inconnu" when counting options
- **Removed** because "Unknown" will never appear in canonical hierarchy (curated years only)
- Kept "Not Specified" filtering to prevent UI placeholders from being counted as valid options

### ‚úÖ Phase 7: Documentation Updates
**File:** `REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md`

**Added comprehensive sections:**
1. **Badge System** - Updated descriptions for 3-color system
2. **Picker Options table** - Shows NULL vs "Unknown" distinction
3. **Smart Auto-Assignment** - Clarified that "Unknown" never appears in hierarchy
4. **Workflow guidance** - Orange = needs attention, Green = decision made

---

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### Architectural Decisions

1. **"Unknown" is a real enum value, not UI-only:**
   - Database schema includes `("U", "Unknown")` in `fuel_type_enum`
   - Database schema includes `("UNK", "Unknown")` in `classification_enum`
   - Stored in database when user explicitly marks field as unknowable

2. **Placeholder ID pattern for special options:**
   - "Unknown" option in picker uses ID `-1` as placeholder
   - Save logic detects `-1` and looks up real ID from database
   - Load logic creates matching instance with `-1` for SwiftUI binding

3. **Three-state badge system:**
   - üî¥ Red "Unassigned" = No mapping exists
   - üü† Orange "Needs Review" = Mapping exists, fields are NULL
   - üü¢ Green "Complete" = Both fields assigned (including "Unknown")

4. **"Unknown" never appears in canonical hierarchy:**
   - Canonical hierarchy = curated years (2011-2022) only
   - "Unknown" was never used in curated data
   - Only appears in regularization UI pickers as special option

5. **NULL means unreviewed, "Unknown" means reviewed:**
   - NULL = User hasn't looked at this field yet
   - "Unknown" = User reviewed and determined it's unknowable
   - Allows tracking which pairs need attention

### Coding Patterns

1. **Creating CategoricalEnumManager instances:**
   ```swift
   let enumManager = CategoricalEnumManager(databaseManager: databaseManager)
   let id = try await enumManager.getEnumId(table: "...", column: "...", value: "...")
   ```
   Pattern used in `OptimizedQueryManager` and `SchemaManager`

2. **Special picker options:**
   ```swift
   Text("Unknown").tag(MakeModelHierarchy.FuelTypeInfo(
       id: -1,  // Placeholder - resolved at save time
       code: "U",
       description: "Unknown",
       recordCount: 0
   ) as MakeModelHierarchy.FuelTypeInfo?)
   ```

3. **Loading special values from database:**
   ```swift
   if fuelTypeName == "Unknown" {
       selectedFuelType = MakeModelHierarchy.FuelTypeInfo(
           id: -1, code: "U", description: "Unknown", recordCount: 0
       )
   } else {
       selectedFuelType = model.fuelTypes.first { $0.description == fuelTypeName }
   }
   ```

## 5. Current State

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented & Tested
1. **Database schema** - "Unknown" enum values added to both tables
2. **Badge system** - 3 colors with accurate labels
3. **Picker UI** - "Unknown" option appears correctly
4. **Save logic** - Placeholder ID resolution working
5. **Load logic** - Fixed picker binding issue
6. **Documentation** - Comprehensive user guide

### üîß Recently Fixed Issues
1. **Build error** - `DatabaseManager` doesn't expose `categoricalEnumManager` property
   - **Fix:** Create `CategoricalEnumManager` instance directly in save function

2. **Picker reversion bug** - "Unknown" selections reverted to "Not Specified" after save
   - **Fix:** Added special handling in `loadMappingForSelectedPair()` to create matching instances

3. **HMN code mismatch** - HMN incorrectly mapped to "Other/Unknown" instead of "Off-road snowmobile"
   - **Fix:** Corrected description and added missing off-road codes

### üìù Database State
- User has **deleted** old database files
- User has **rebuilt** database from scratch with abbreviated test dataset
- "Unknown" enum values should now exist in fresh database
- Ready for functional testing

## 6. Next Steps

### Immediate Testing (User Currently Doing)
1. ‚úÖ Verify "Unknown" appears in pickers (CONFIRMED - user sees it)
2. üîß Test save/load cycle with "Unknown" values (IN PROGRESS)
   - Select "Unknown" for FuelType
   - Select "Unknown" for VehicleType
   - Click "Save Mapping"
   - Expected: Green checkmarks persist, badge turns green ‚úÖ
   - Previous bug: Reverted to "Not Specified" ‚ùå
   - Fix applied: Special instance creation in load logic

3. **Verify badge colors** work correctly:
   - üî¥ Red "Unassigned" before creating mapping
   - üü† Orange "Needs Review" after auto-assignment with NULL fields
   - üü¢ Green "Complete" after setting both fields to "Unknown"

4. **Test NULL vs Unknown toggle:**
   - Create mapping with "Unknown" ‚Üí Green badge
   - Edit, set back to "Not Specified" ‚Üí Orange badge
   - Edit, set to "Unknown" again ‚Üí Green badge

## 7. Important Context

### Errors Solved

#### Error 1: Build Failure - CategoricalEnumManager Access
**Symptom:**
```
Value of type 'DatabaseManager' has no member 'categoricalEnumManager'
```

**Cause:** `DatabaseManager` doesn't expose `categoricalEnumManager` as a public property.

**Solution:** Create instance directly:
```swift
let enumManager = CategoricalEnumManager(databaseManager: databaseManager)
let id = try await enumManager.getEnumId(...)
```

This follows the pattern used in `OptimizedQueryManager.swift` line 38 and `SchemaManager.swift` line 12.

---

#### Error 2: Picker Binding Failure - "Unknown" Reverts to "Not Specified"
**Symptom:**
- User selects "Unknown" in picker
- Green checkmark appears
- Click "Save Mapping"
- Picker reverts to "Not Specified"
- Green checkmark disappears
- Badge stays orange

**Root Cause:**
1. User selects "Unknown" ‚Üí Creates instance with `id: -1`
2. Save resolves `-1` to real database ID, saves successfully
3. Reload fetches mapping with `fuelType="Unknown"` (description from database)
4. Code tries to find "Unknown" in `model.fuelTypes` array
5. "Unknown" not in array (only in curated hierarchy)
6. Search fails, `selectedFuelType` remains `nil`
7. Picker shows "Not Specified"

**Solution:** Special handling in `loadMappingForSelectedPair()`:
```swift
if fuelTypeName == "Unknown" {
    // Create instance matching picker option
    selectedFuelType = MakeModelHierarchy.FuelTypeInfo(
        id: -1, code: "U", description: "Unknown", recordCount: 0
    )
} else {
    selectedFuelType = model.fuelTypes.first { $0.description == fuelTypeName }
}
```

Same logic for VehicleType checking for `vehicleTypeName == "UNK"`.

---

#### Error 3: HMN Code Mismatch
**Symptom:** Classification code HMN mapped to "Other/Unknown classification"

**Cause:** Incorrect hardcoded value in `populateClassificationEnum()`

**Schema Truth:** `Vehicle-Registration-Schema.md` line 57 states HMN = "Off-road snowmobile"

**Solution:**
- Changed HMN description to "Off-road snowmobile"
- Added missing codes: HAB (Off-road bus), HCA (Off-road truck/road tractor), HVT (Off-road all-terrain vehicle), HVO (Off-road tool vehicle)
- All codes now verified against schema document

---

### Key Learnings

1. **SwiftUI Picker Binding Requires Exact Instance Match:**
   - Picker can't match by value equality, needs reference/structural equality
   - When "Unknown" comes from database, must recreate exact instance structure
   - Placeholder ID `-1` provides consistent identity

2. **"Unknown" Never in Canonical Hierarchy:**
   - Canonical hierarchy = curated years (2011-2022)
   - "Unknown" enum value wasn't used in curated data
   - Only appears in regularization UI as special option
   - No need to filter "Unknown" when counting auto-assignment options

3. **Three-State Badge System Semantics:**
   - Red = No work started
   - Orange = Work in progress (needs review)
   - Green = Work complete (decision made, even if decision is "Unknown")

4. **Database Enum Lookups:**
   - `CategoricalEnumManager.getEnumId()` is the standard way to resolve codes to IDs
   - Always use code column for lookups ("U", "UNK")
   - Returns `Int?` - handle nil case

### Console Messages to Watch For

**Successful "Unknown" save:**
```
üîç Searching fuel_type_enum.code for value: 'U'
‚úÖ Found match: 'U' -> ID 11
üîç Searching classification_enum.code for value: 'UNK'
‚úÖ Found match: 'UNK' -> ID 31
‚úÖ Saved mapping: HONDA/CIVIC ‚Üí HONDA CIVIC
```

**Successful "Unknown" load:**
```
üìã Loaded existing mapping for HONDA CIVIC (HONDA)
```

**If ID lookup fails:**
```
‚ùå No match found for 'U' in fuel_type_enum.code
```
This indicates "Unknown" wasn't added to database - rebuild required.

---

### Workflow Recap

**User Workflow (Expected):**
1. Delete old database files
2. Launch app ‚Üí Fresh database created with "Unknown" enum values
3. Import CSV files (abbreviated 10K records/year)
4. Open RegularizationView
5. Select uncurated pair with orange "Needs Review" badge
6. Set FuelType to "Unknown"
7. Set VehicleType to "Unknown"
8. Click "Save Mapping"
9. **Expected:** Green checkmarks persist, badge turns green ‚úÖ
10. **Previous bug:** Reverted to "Not Specified" ‚ùå
11. **Fix applied:** Lines 967-1000 in RegularizationView.swift

**System Workflow:**
1. Picker selection creates instance with ID `-1`
2. Save detects `-1`, looks up real ID from database
3. Saves mapping with real ID
4. Reloads mapping from database (description "Unknown" or code "UNK")
5. Load logic detects "Unknown"/"UNK" string
6. Creates matching instance with ID `-1`
7. SwiftUI binds to picker correctly
8. Green checkmark appears and persists ‚úÖ
