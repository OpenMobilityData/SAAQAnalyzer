# Regularization UX Improvements - Session Complete

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: âœ… Complete and Committed
**Branch**: `rhoge-dev`
**Commit**: `a9643c6`

---

## 1. Current Task & Objective

### Primary Goal
Enhance the RegularizationView UI with better filtering and visibility features to improve the workflow efficiency for managing Make/Model regularization mappings.

### Initial Requirements
User requested two specific enhancements:
1. **Status Button Counts**: Add current record counts to the Unassigned, Needs Review, and Complete status filter buttons
2. **Vehicle Type Filter**: Add filtering by vehicle type with toggle to switch between:
   - All vehicle types in the schema
   - Only vehicle types present in the regularization list (including 'Unknown' or 'Not Assigned')

### Additional Improvements Discovered
During implementation, several UX issues were identified and fixed:
- Status buttons were clipping their content
- Vehicle type filter needed "Not Assigned" option
- UK (Unknown) vehicle type should be at end of list, not alphabetical
- Pair count label should say "Make/Model pairs" for clarity

---

## 2. Progress Completed

### âœ… All Features Implemented and Committed

#### Feature 1: Status Button Counts
- Added `statusCounts` computed property to calculate real-time counts
- Updated `StatusFilterButton` component to accept and display count parameter
- Status buttons now show: "Unassigned (553)", "Needs Review (77)", "Complete (278)"
- Tooltips enhanced to include count information

**Implementation:**
- Location: `RegularizationView.swift` lines 77-95 (statusCounts property)
- UI: lines 188-209 (button rendering with counts)
- Component: lines 1545-1578 (StatusFilterButton struct)

#### Feature 2: Vehicle Type Filter
**Database Layer:**
- Added `getAllVehicleTypes()` method in `RegularizationManager.swift` (lines 1053-1091)
  - Queries `vehicle_type_enum` table for all schema types
  - Returns array of `MakeModelHierarchy.VehicleTypeInfo`
- Added `getRegularizationVehicleTypes()` method (lines 1093-1138)
  - Queries types actually used in regularization mappings
  - Includes mapping count for each type

**UI Layer:**
- Added state variables for filter control (lines 67-68)
- Added Published properties in ViewModel (lines 782-783)
- Created `loadVehicleTypes()` method (lines 854-873)
- Integrated into `loadInitialData()` workflow (line 842)
- Added filter UI section with toggle and picker (lines 212-261)
- Implemented filtering logic in `filteredAndSortedPairs` (lines 121-145)
- Added helper method `getVehicleTypeCode()` (lines 1308-1319)

#### Feature 3: UI Refinements
1. **UK at End of List**: Custom sorting places "UK - Unknown" at end (lines 230-234)
2. **Not Assigned Option**: Added "NA" option for pairs without vehicle type (line 223)
3. **Toggle Behavior**: onChange handler preserves selection when switching modes (lines 227-234)
4. **Button Clipping Fix**:
   - Increased padding from 6px to 8px
   - Added `.fixedSize(horizontal: true, vertical: false)`
   - Added `.lineLimit(1)` to text
   - Reduced HStack spacing from 16px to 8px
5. **Label Update**: Changed "XXX pairs" to "XXX Make/Model pairs" (line 266)

#### Documentation Updates
- Updated `REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md` with new filtering features (lines 293-326)
- Added section on vehicle type filter with usage examples
- Documented status count display and toggle behavior

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### Vehicle Type Code Pattern
**Problem**: Vehicle types are stored as descriptions in mappings but need to be filtered by code.

**Solution**: Added `getVehicleTypeCode()` helper that looks up code from description in both `allVehicleTypes` and `regularizationVehicleTypes` arrays.

```swift
func getVehicleTypeCode(for description: String) -> String? {
    if let vehicleType = allVehicleTypes.first(where: { $0.description == description }) {
        return vehicleType.code
    }
    if let vehicleType = regularizationVehicleTypes.first(where: { $0.description == description }) {
        return vehicleType.code
    }
    return nil
}
```

### Sorting Pattern for Special Values
**Pattern**: When special values (like "Unknown") need to be at end of alphabetically sorted lists:

```swift
let sortedTypes = vehicleTypes.sorted { type1, type2 in
    if type1.code == "UK" { return false }
    if type2.code == "UK" { return true }
    return type1.code < type2.code
}
```

This pattern is also used in FilterPanel.swift for vehicle type filters (lines 1264-1272).

### Not Assigned Filtering Logic
**Special Code**: "NA" is used as a tag for the "Not Assigned" option (not a real vehicle type code).

**Filtering Logic**:
```swift
if selectedCode == "NA" {
    // Include pairs with no mapping OR pairs with mapping but NULL vehicle type
    if let mapping = wildcardMapping {
        return mapping.vehicleType == nil
    }
    return true  // No mapping at all = not assigned
}
```

### Toggle Preservation Pattern
When toggling between all types and regularization-only types, preserve user's selection if it exists in the new list:

```swift
.onChange(of: showOnlyRegularizationVehicleTypes) { _, newValue in
    if newValue, let selectedCode = selectedVehicleTypeFilter {
        if selectedCode != "NA" && !viewModel.regularizationVehicleTypes.contains(where: { $0.code == selectedCode }) {
            selectedVehicleTypeFilter = nil
        }
    }
}
```

### Status Count Calculation
**Performance**: Counts are computed on-demand (computed property), not cached. This is acceptable because:
- The list size is manageable (hundreds of pairs, not thousands)
- Counts update in real-time as filtering/work progresses
- SwiftUI's caching handles redundant calculations

git push origin rhoge-dev
```

### ðŸ”µ FUTURE - Potential Enhancements

Based on the current workflow, potential future improvements could include:

1. **Count Badges on Filter Buttons**: Consider adding counts to other filter types (Make, Model, etc.)
2. **Filter Presets**: Save/load common filter combinations
3. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple pairs and apply vehicle type in batch
4. **Progress Tracking**: Overall regularization progress bar or statistics
5. **Export Filtered Results**: Export current filtered list to CSV for review

---

## 7. Important Context

### Issue Resolution: Status Button Clipping

**Problem**: Status buttons were clipping text content, especially with longer labels like "Needs Review (77)".

**Root Cause**: SwiftUI's default button sizing was compressing content to fit available space.

**Solution**:
1. Added `.fixedSize(horizontal: true, vertical: false)` to prevent horizontal compression
2. Increased horizontal padding from 6px to 8px
3. Added `.lineLimit(1)` to prevent wrapping
4. Reduced HStack spacing from 16px to 8px to free up more space

This fix ensures buttons always have enough room to display their full content.

### Issue Resolution: Toggle Collapsing Options

**Problem**: When toggling "In regularization list only" to ON, the picker would collapse to just "All Types" instead of showing available types.

**Root Cause**: The picker was correctly switching data sources, but if the current selection wasn't in the new list, it would revert to nil without visual feedback.

**Solution**: Added `onChange` handler that:
1. Checks if current selection exists in the new list
2. Only clears selection if it's NOT in the new list
3. Preserves "All Types" (nil) and "Not Assigned" ("NA") selections always
4. Keeps valid vehicle type selections that exist in both lists

### Vehicle Type Enum Values

The vehicle type system uses two-character codes matching the SAAQ TYP_VEH_CATEG_USA field:

**Real Vehicle Types** (from schema):
- AB - Bus
- AT - Dealer Plates
- AU - Automobile or Light Truck
- CA - Truck or Road Tractor
- CY - Moped
- HM - Motorhome
- MC - Motorcycle
- MN - Snowmobile
- NV - Other Off-Road Vehicle
- SN - Snow Blower
- VO - Tool Vehicle
- VT - All-Terrain Vehicle

**Special Value**:
- UK - Unknown (user-assigned, not in source data)

**Note**: The UK code was recently changed from UNK to match the two-character pattern (see commit f69ffe6 and session note 2025-10-10-Vehicle-Type-UK-Code-Fix-Complete.md).

### Database Query Pattern

The vehicle type query methods follow the established pattern from the canonical hierarchy generation:

```sql
SELECT id, code, description
FROM vehicle_type_enum
ORDER BY code;
```

For regularization-only types, we join with the mapping table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    vt.id,
    vt.code,
    vt.description,
    COUNT(r.id) as mapping_count
FROM make_model_regularization r
JOIN vehicle_type_enum vt ON r.vehicle_type_id = vt.id
GROUP BY vt.id, vt.code, vt.description
ORDER BY vt.code;
```

This provides the count of mappings using each type, which could be displayed in future UI enhancements.

### Filtering Architecture

The regularization view uses a multi-stage filtering approach:

1. **Search Filter**: Text-based filtering on make/model names
2. **Status Filter**: Three independent toggles (Unassigned, Needs Review, Complete)
3. **Vehicle Type Filter**: Dropdown with all types, regularization types, or "Not Assigned"
4. **Sorting**: Four sort options (record count high/low, alphabetical, percentage)

All filters work together - results must pass ALL active filters. The `filteredAndSortedPairs` computed property applies filters sequentially for clarity and maintainability.

### Code Ownership

**Recent Commits on rhoge-dev** (relevant to this work):
- `a9643c6` - feat: Add status counts and vehicle type filtering to RegularizationView (THIS SESSION)
- `f69ffe6` - fix: Use UK code for Unknown vehicle type and restore AT to Dealer Plates
- `60f9c2f` - chore: Track session notes and update .gitignore for Notes/*.md files

All changes in this session build upon the existing regularization system implemented in earlier sessions (documented in Notes directory).
