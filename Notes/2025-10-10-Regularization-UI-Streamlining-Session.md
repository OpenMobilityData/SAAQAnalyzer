# Regularization UI Streamlining & Enhanced Statistics Session

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: ⚙️ In Progress - Statistics Query Implementation
**Branch**: `rhoge-dev`
**Working Tree**: Uncommitted changes in progress

---

## 1. Current Task & Objective

### Primary Goal
Streamline the Regularization Settings UI by removing manual maintenance buttons and adding enhanced field-specific statistics to give users better visibility into regularization coverage.

### Problem Being Solved
**Issue 1**: Manual cache management complexity
- "Reload Filter Cache" button required users to manually trigger cache updates
- "Generate Canonical Hierarchy" button was redundant (hierarchy generation happens automatically)
- Orange warning indicators for cache staleness created unnecessary user anxiety
- Manual steps interrupted workflow and were error-prone

**Issue 2**: Limited statistics visibility
- Current statistics only show aggregate counts (mappings, covered records, total records)
- Users can't see field-specific coverage (e.g., "80% of uncurated records have Vehicle Type assigned")
- No breakdown by field type (Make/Model, Fuel Type, Vehicle Type)
- Difficult to identify which fields need more regularization work

### Solution Approach
1. **Remove manual buttons**: Delete "Reload Filter Cache" and "Generate Canonical Hierarchy" buttons
2. **Automatic cache invalidation**: Trigger cache reload automatically when year configuration changes
3. **Enhanced statistics**: Create `DetailedRegularizationStatistics` struct with field-specific coverage metrics
4. **Improved UI**: Display coverage breakdown by field type in statistics section

---

## 2. Progress Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Automatic Cache Invalidation (COMPLETE)

**Files Modified**: `SAAQAnalyzer/SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift`

**Changes**:
1. **Removed state variables** (lines 1721, 1726):
   - Deleted: `@State private var isGeneratingHierarchy = false`
   - Deleted: `@State private var cacheNeedsReload = false`

2. **Replaced onChange handlers** (lines 1810-1829):
   - **Before**: Called `checkCacheStaleness()` which set warning flag
   - **After**: Automatically call `filterCacheManager?.invalidateCache()` when year config changes
   - Includes console logging: `"✅ Filter cache invalidated automatically (curated/uncurated years changed)"`

3. **Auto-reload on RegularizationView close** (lines 82-88):
   - Existing `.onChange(of: showingRegularizationView)` handler already triggers cache reload
   - Ensures cache refreshes after user completes regularization work

**Pattern Used**:
```swift
.onChange(of: yearConfig.curatedYears) { oldValue, newValue in
    Task {
        databaseManager.filterCacheManager?.invalidateCache()
        await MainActor.run {
            lastCachedYearConfig = yearConfig
        }
        print("✅ Filter cache invalidated automatically (curated years changed)")
    }
}
```

**Result**: Cache invalidation now happens automatically without user intervention ✅

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Remove Manual Buttons (COMPLETE)

**File Modified**: `SAAQAnalyzer/SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift`

**Changes** (lines 1831-1839):
- **Before**: Section("Regularization Actions") contained 3 buttons in VStack
  - "Reload Filter Cache" with orange warning indicator
  - "Generate Canonical Hierarchy" button
  - "Manage Regularization Mappings" button (PRIMARY ACTION)

- **After**: Section now contains only the primary action button
  ```swift
  Section("Regularization Actions") {
      Button(isFindingUncurated ? "Finding Uncurated Pairs..." : "Manage Regularization Mappings") {
          showingRegularizationView = true
      }
      .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
      .buttonBorderShape(.roundedRectangle)
      .disabled(isFindingUncurated)
      .help("Open the regularization management interface")
  }
  ```

**Removed Code**:
- `rebuildEnumerations()` function no longer called from UI (still exists for auto-reload)
- `checkCacheStaleness()` function no longer needed
- Orange warning icon and "Settings changed" text removed
- Hierarchy generation button removed

**Result**: Cleaner UI with one clear action button ✅

---

### ⚙️ Phase 3: Enhanced Statistics Implementation (IN PROGRESS)

**Current Status**: Working on creating detailed statistics query

**Design Completed**:
- Changed statistics type from tuple to struct:
  ```swift
  // OLD: @State private var statistics: (mappingCount: Int, coveredRecords: Int, totalRecords: Int)?
  // NEW: @State private var statistics: DetailedRegularizationStatistics?
  ```

**Next Implementation Steps**:

1. **Create `DetailedRegularizationStatistics` struct** (NOT YET CREATED)
   - Location: `SAAQAnalyzer/Models/DataModels.swift` or `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/RegularizationManager.swift`
   - Required fields:
     ```swift
     struct DetailedRegularizationStatistics {
         let mappingCount: Int
         let totalUncuratedRecords: Int

         // Field-specific coverage
         let makeModelCoverage: FieldCoverage
         let fuelTypeCoverage: FieldCoverage
         let vehicleTypeCoverage: FieldCoverage

         struct FieldCoverage {
             let assignedCount: Int      // Records with this field assigned via regularization
             let unassignedCount: Int    // Records without this field assigned
             let totalRecords: Int       // Total uncurated records

             var coveragePercentage: Double {
                 guard totalRecords > 0 else { return 0.0 }
                 return Double(assignedCount) / Double(totalRecords) * 100.0
             }
         }

         var overallCoverage: Double {
             guard totalUncuratedRecords > 0 else { return 0.0 }
             let coveredRecords = makeModelCoverage.assignedCount // Or use max of all fields
             return Double(coveredRecords) / Double(totalUncuratedRecords) * 100.0
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Create query method in RegularizationManager** (IN PROGRESS)
   - Location: `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/RegularizationManager.swift`
   - Method signature: `func getDetailedRegularizationStatistics() async throws -> DetailedRegularizationStatistics`
   - Query approach:
     ```sql
     -- Total mappings
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM make_model_regularization;

     -- Total uncurated records (based on year configuration)
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles v
     JOIN year_enum ye ON v.year_id = ye.id
     WHERE ye.year IN (uncurated_years);

     -- Make/Model coverage (records with canonical assignment)
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles v
     JOIN year_enum ye ON v.year_id = ye.id
     WHERE ye.year IN (uncurated_years)
     AND EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 FROM make_model_regularization r
         WHERE r.uncurated_make_id = v.make_id
         AND r.uncurated_model_id = v.model_id
         AND r.canonical_make_id IS NOT NULL
         AND r.canonical_model_id IS NOT NULL
     );

     -- Fuel Type coverage (records with fuel type assigned)
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles v
     JOIN year_enum ye ON v.year_id = ye.id
     WHERE ye.year IN (uncurated_years)
     AND EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 FROM make_model_regularization r
         WHERE r.uncurated_make_id = v.make_id
         AND r.uncurated_model_id = v.model_id
         AND (r.model_year_id = v.model_year_id OR r.model_year_id IS NULL)
         AND r.fuel_type_id IS NOT NULL
     );

     -- Vehicle Type coverage (records with vehicle type assigned)
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles v
     JOIN year_enum ye ON v.year_id = ye.id
     WHERE ye.year IN (uncurated_years)
     AND EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 FROM make_model_regularization r
         WHERE r.uncurated_make_id = v.make_id
         AND r.uncurated_model_id = v.model_id
         AND r.vehicle_type_id IS NOT NULL
     );
     ```

3. **Update statistics UI** (PENDING)
   - Location: `SAAQAnalyzer/SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift` (lines 1953-1989)
   - Replace current statistics display with field-specific breakdown:
     ```swift
     if let stats = statistics {
         VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 8) {
             Text("Active Mappings: \(stats.mappingCount)")
                 .font(.system(.body, design: .monospaced))

             Divider()

             Text("Field Coverage")
                 .font(.headline)

             // Make/Model coverage
             FieldCoverageRow(
                 field: "Make/Model",
                 coverage: stats.makeModelCoverage
             )

             // Fuel Type coverage
             FieldCoverageRow(
                 field: "Fuel Type",
                 coverage: stats.fuelTypeCoverage
             )

             // Vehicle Type coverage
             FieldCoverageRow(
                 field: "Vehicle Type",
                 coverage: stats.vehicleTypeCoverage
             )

             Divider()

             Text("Overall Coverage: \(String(format: "%.1f", stats.overallCoverage))%")
                 .font(.system(.body, design: .monospaced))
                 .foregroundColor(stats.overallCoverage > 50 ? .green : .orange)
         }
     }

     // Helper view
     struct FieldCoverageRow: View {
         let field: String
         let coverage: DetailedRegularizationStatistics.FieldCoverage

         var body: some View {
             VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 2) {
                 HStack {
                     Text(field)
                         .font(.caption)
                     Spacer()
                     Text("\(String(format: "%.1f", coverage.coveragePercentage))%")
                         .font(.caption)
                         .fontWeight(.medium)
                         .foregroundColor(coverage.coveragePercentage > 50 ? .green : .orange)
                 }
                 ProgressView(value: coverage.coveragePercentage, total: 100)
                     .tint(coverage.coveragePercentage > 50 ? .green : .orange)
             }
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Update `loadStatistics()` method** (PENDING)
   - Change to call new `getDetailedRegularizationStatistics()` method
   - Handle new struct type instead of tuple

---

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### A. Automatic Cache Invalidation Strategy

**Decision**: Use `.onChange()` modifiers to trigger cache invalidation automatically

**Rationale**:
- Users shouldn't need to think about cache management
- Year configuration changes always require cache refresh
- Closing RegularizationView always means potential data changes

**Pattern Established**:
```swift
.onChange(of: configurationProperty) { oldValue, newValue in
    Task {
        databaseManager.filterCacheManager?.invalidateCache()
        await MainActor.run {
            // Update tracking state
        }
        print("✅ Cache invalidated automatically (reason)")
    }
}
```

**Applied To**:
- `yearConfig.curatedYears` changes
- `yearConfig.uncuratedYears` changes
- `showingRegularizationView` closing (already existing)

### B. Statistics Architecture

**Decision**: Use structured `DetailedRegularizationStatistics` type instead of tuple

**Rationale**:
- Tuples don't scale well (already at 3 fields, adding more would be unwieldy)
- Struct provides clear naming and type safety
- Nested `FieldCoverage` struct allows reuse for different field types
- Computed properties can derive percentage calculations

**Alternative Considered**: Keep tuple and just add more fields
**Rejected Because**: Tuple access syntax gets messy (`stats.0`, `stats.1`, etc.)

### C. Field Coverage Design

**Decision**: Track three separate coverage metrics (Make/Model, Fuel Type, Vehicle Type)

**Rationale**:
- Each field has different regularization patterns
- Users need to see which fields need more work
- Visual progress bars make it immediately clear where gaps exist

**Fields Chosen**:
1. **Make/Model**: Core regularization (canonical assignment)
2. **Fuel Type**: Year-specific triplet mappings
3. **Vehicle Type**: Wildcard mappings (one per Make/Model pair)

**Not Tracked** (yet):
- Color, Cylinder Count, etc. (less critical for analysis)
- Could add later if users request

---

## 6. Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Statistics Query Implementation

**Step 1**: Define `DetailedRegularizationStatistics` struct
- File: `SAAQAnalyzer/Models/DataModels.swift`
- Location: After `RegularizationYearConfiguration` (around line 1800)
- Include: Main struct + nested `FieldCoverage` struct with computed properties

**Step 2**: Implement `getDetailedRegularizationStatistics()` in RegularizationManager
- File: `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/RegularizationManager.swift`
- Location: After existing `getRegularizationStatistics()` method (around line 600)
- Tasks:
  1. Get uncurated year list from configuration
  2. Query total uncurated records
  3. Query Make/Model coverage (EXISTS with canonical assignment check)
  4. Query Fuel Type coverage (EXISTS with fuel_type_id check)
  5. Query Vehicle Type coverage (EXISTS with vehicle_type_id check)
  6. Assemble `DetailedRegularizationStatistics` struct
  7. Return result

**SQL Query Pattern** (for reference):
```swift
// Get uncurated years
let uncuratedYears = yearConfiguration.uncuratedYears.map { String($0) }.joined(separator: ",")

// Total uncurated records
let totalQuery = """
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles v
    JOIN year_enum ye ON v.year_id = ye.id
    WHERE ye.year IN (\(uncuratedYears))
"""

// Make/Model coverage
let makeModelQuery = """
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles v
    JOIN year_enum ye ON v.year_id = ye.id
    WHERE ye.year IN (\(uncuratedYears))
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM make_model_regularization r
        WHERE r.uncurated_make_id = v.make_id
        AND r.uncurated_model_id = v.model_id
        AND r.canonical_make_id IS NOT NULL
    )
"""

// Similar patterns for Fuel Type and Vehicle Type
```

### Priority 2: Update Statistics UI

**Step 3**: Create `FieldCoverageRow` helper view
- File: `SAAQAnalyzer/SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift`
- Location: End of file (after other view structs)
- Display: Field name, percentage, progress bar

**Step 4**: Update statistics display section
- File: `SAAQAnalyzer/SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift`
- Location: Lines 1961-1981 (replace existing VStack)
- Show: Active mappings + field-specific coverage + overall coverage

**Step 5**: Update `loadStatistics()` method
- File: `SAAQAnalyzer/SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift`
- Location: Lines 149-171
- Change: Call `getDetailedRegularizationStatistics()` instead of `getRegularizationStatistics()`

### Priority 3: Testing & Verification

**Step 6**: Test with abbreviated dataset
- Open Settings → Regularization tab
- Click "Refresh Statistics"
- Verify:
  - Mapping count correct
  - Field coverage percentages calculated correctly
  - Progress bars display properly
  - Overall coverage matches expectations

**Step 7**: Test with full dataset (if available)
- Same verification steps as abbreviated dataset
- Check performance (queries should use indexes efficiently)

### Priority 4: Commit & Document

**Step 8**: Stage and commit changes
```bash
git add SAAQAnalyzer/SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift
git add SAAQAnalyzer/Models/DataModels.swift
git add SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/RegularizationManager.swift
git commit -m "feat: Streamline regularization UI with auto-cache and enhanced statistics

- Remove manual Reload Filter Cache button
- Remove Generate Canonical Hierarchy button
- Add automatic cache invalidation on year config changes
- Implement field-specific coverage statistics (Make/Model, Fuel Type, Vehicle Type)
- Display coverage breakdown with progress bars in settings UI

Improves UX by eliminating manual maintenance steps and providing
better visibility into regularization progress."
```

**Step 9**: Update documentation (if needed)
- `CLAUDE.md`: Update if any new patterns established
- `Documentation/REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md`: Update statistics section if significantly changed

---

## 7. Important Context

### A. Why Remove Manual Buttons?

**User Pain Point**: Manual cache management was confusing
- Users didn't know when to click "Reload Filter Cache"
- Orange warning indicators created anxiety
- Multiple buttons created decision paralysis

**Solution**: Automatic invalidation on relevant events
- Year config changes → auto-invalidate
- RegularizationView closes → auto-invalidate
- No user action required

**Trade-off**: Users can't force cache reload manually
- Acceptable: All automatic triggers cover necessary cases
- Edge case: If cache somehow gets out of sync, restarting app would fix it

### B. Cache Invalidation Timing

**Key Insight**: Cache invalidation happens immediately, but reload happens on-demand

**Current Implementation**:
```swift
databaseManager.filterCacheManager?.invalidateCache()
```
- Sets `cachedData = nil` immediately
- Next filter panel access will trigger reload
- Console message: "💡 Open the Filter panel to trigger cache reload with latest Make/Model values"

**User Experience**:
1. User changes year configuration in Settings → cache invalidated
2. User closes Settings, opens Filter panel → cache reloads automatically
3. New Make/Model values appear in dropdowns

**No Delay**: Invalidation is instant, reload is lazy (on first access)

### C. Statistics Query Performance

**Concern**: Multiple EXISTS subqueries could be slow

**Mitigation**:
- All joins use indexed columns (`make_id`, `model_id`, `model_year_id`, `year_id`)
- EXISTS stops at first match (efficient for coverage checks)
- Uncurated years subset limits row count
- Query pattern similar to existing filter queries (proven fast)

**Expected Performance**: Sub-second even with millions of records

**Fallback**: If slow, could combine queries using CASE statements to reduce round-trips

### D. Field Coverage Calculation Logic

**Make/Model Coverage**:
- **Assigned**: Records with `EXISTS (r.canonical_make_id IS NOT NULL AND r.canonical_model_id IS NOT NULL)`
- **Meaning**: Uncurated pair mapped to canonical pair
- **Why track**: Core regularization metric

**Fuel Type Coverage**:
- **Assigned**: Records with `EXISTS (r.fuel_type_id IS NOT NULL)`
- **Meaning**: Uncurated pair has fuel type assigned (triplet or wildcard)
- **Why track**: Important for pre-2017 data enrichment and 2017+ corrections

**Vehicle Type Coverage**:
- **Assigned**: Records with `EXISTS (r.vehicle_type_id IS NOT NULL)`
- **Meaning**: Uncurated pair has vehicle type assigned (wildcard)
- **Why track**: Critical for physical vehicle classification

**Overall Coverage**:
- **Current approach**: Use Make/Model coverage as proxy (most comprehensive)
- **Alternative**: Could use MAX of all three fields
- **Why this matters**: Tells user "X% of uncurated records have at least some regularization"

### E. Gotchas and Edge Cases

**Gotcha 1: Statistics Show 0% When No Uncurated Years**

**Scenario**: User sets all years as "Curated" in configuration

**Result**: `totalUncuratedRecords = 0`, all coverage percentages = 0%

**Solution**: Guard clause in `coveragePercentage` computed property:
```swift
var coveragePercentage: Double {
    guard totalRecords > 0 else { return 0.0 }
    return Double(assignedCount) / Double(totalRecords) * 100.0
}
```

**UI**: Display "0%" or "N/A" - both acceptable

**Gotcha 2: Field Coverage Can Exceed 100% (Not Possible with Current Logic)**

**Scenario**: Multiple mappings for same uncurated pair?

**Reality**: Database schema prevents this (UNIQUE constraint on uncurated_make_id + uncurated_model_id)

**Safe**: Current logic guarantees coverage ≤ 100%

**Gotcha 3: Triplet vs Wildcard Mapping Counts**

**Question**: Should Fuel Type coverage count only triplet mappings or include wildcards?

**Current Design**: Count EXISTS with `fuel_type_id IS NOT NULL` (includes both)
- Triplet: `model_year_id = specific_year AND fuel_type_id IS NOT NULL`
- Wildcard: `model_year_id IS NULL AND fuel_type_id IS NOT NULL`

**Implication**: Coverage metric includes all fuel type assignments regardless of specificity

**Alternative**: Could separate triplet vs wildcard coverage if needed

**Decision**: Start simple (combined count), refine later if users request breakdown

## 8. Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Year Configuration Change

**Setup**:
- Open Settings → Regularization tab
- Note current cache state

**Action**: Toggle year 2023 from "Curated" to "Uncurated"

**Expected**:
- Console: "✅ Filter cache invalidated automatically (uncurated years changed)"
- No orange warning indicators
- No manual button clicks required

**Verify**: Open Filter panel → Make/Model dropdowns include 2023 uncurated values

---

### Test Case 2: Statistics Display

**Setup**: Database with known regularization mappings

**Action**: Click "Refresh Statistics" button

**Expected**:
- Loading indicator appears
- Statistics load showing:
  - Active Mappings: [count]
  - Make/Model: [percentage]% with progress bar
  - Fuel Type: [percentage]% with progress bar
  - Vehicle Type: [percentage]% with progress bar
  - Overall Coverage: [percentage]%

**Verify**:
- Percentages make sense (0-100%)
- Progress bars match percentages
- Colors: green if >50%, orange if ≤50%

---

### Test Case 3: No Uncurated Years Edge Case

**Setup**:
- Set all years as "Curated" in configuration
- Open Settings → Regularization tab

**Action**: Click "Refresh Statistics"

**Expected**:
- Statistics load showing:
  - Active Mappings: [count] (unchanged)
  - Make/Model: 0%
  - Fuel Type: 0%
  - Vehicle Type: 0%
  - Overall Coverage: 0%

**Verify**: No crashes, percentages display as 0% (not NaN or error)

---

### Test Case 4: RegularizationView Close Auto-Reload

**Setup**:
- Open Settings → Regularization tab
- Click "Manage Regularization Mappings"

**Action**:
- Create several new mappings in RegularizationView
- Close RegularizationView (click Done or close sheet)

**Expected**:
- Console: "⚠️ RegularizationView closed - reloading filter cache automatically"
- Console: "✅ Filter cache invalidated - will reload on next filter access"

**Verify**: Open Filter panel → New mappings reflected in dropdowns

### FieldCoverageRow Helper View (Ready to Paste)

```swift
/// Display a single field's coverage metrics with progress bar
struct FieldCoverageRow: View {
    let fieldName: String
    let coverage: DetailedRegularizationStatistics.FieldCoverage

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 4) {
            HStack {
                Text(fieldName)
                    .font(.caption)
                    .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
                Spacer()
                Text("\(coverage.assignedCount.formatted()) / \(coverage.totalRecords.formatted())")
                    .font(.caption2)
                    .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
                    .monospacedDigit()
                Text("\(String(format: "%.1f", coverage.coveragePercentage))%")
                    .font(.caption)
                    .fontWeight(.medium)
                    .foregroundColor(coverage.coveragePercentage > 50 ? .green : .orange)
                    .frame(width: 50, alignment: .trailing)
                    .monospacedDigit()
            }

            ProgressView(value: coverage.coveragePercentage, total: 100)
                .tint(coverage.coveragePercentage > 50 ? .green : .orange)
        }
        .padding(.vertical, 4)
    }
}

## 10. Related Sessions & Dependencies

### Prior Work (Same Branch)

**Recent Commits**:
1. `31a1f60` - Triplet fuel type filtering feature (completed earlier today)
2. `7e01941` - Regularization documentation updates
3. `df3225b` - Triplet-aware fuel type filtering implementation
4. `692d5a3` - Auto-populate fields for Unassigned pairs

**Dependencies**:
- Filter cache manager (existing, working)
- Regularization manager (existing, working)
- Year configuration system (existing, working)
- RegularizationView auto-reload (existing, working)

### Architecture Context

**Filter Cache System**:
- Purpose: Load enumeration values for filter dropdowns
- Invalidation: Sets `cachedData = nil`
- Reload: Lazy (on first access after invalidation)
- Used by: FilterPanel (Make/Model/etc. dropdowns)

**Regularization System**:
- Storage: `make_model_regularization` table
- Mappings: Uncurated Make/Model → Canonical Make/Model + optional Fuel Type/Vehicle Type
- Query integration: EXISTS subqueries in OptimizedQueryManager
- UI: RegularizationView for management, Settings tab for configuration

**Year Configuration**:
- Purpose: Define curated vs uncurated years
- Storage: AppSettings (persistent via UserDefaults)
- Used by: Regularization hierarchy generation and statistics

## 11. Summary for Next Session

### What's Been Accomplished This Session

**Completed**:
1. ✅ Removed manual cache management buttons from UI
2. ✅ Implemented automatic cache invalidation on year config changes
3. ✅ Designed enhanced statistics architecture
4. ✅ Changed statistics type from tuple to struct (type only, queries pending)

**Ready to Continue**:
- Implementation of `DetailedRegularizationStatistics` struct (ready to paste)
- Implementation of `getDetailedRegularizationStatistics()` query method (SQL ready)
- UI update for field-specific coverage display (helper view ready)

### What Needs to Happen Next

**Immediate Tasks** (30-60 minutes):
1. Add `DetailedRegularizationStatistics` struct to `DataModels.swift`
2. Implement `getDetailedRegularizationStatistics()` in `RegularizationManager.swift`
3. Add `FieldCoverageRow` view to `SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift`
4. Update statistics display section (lines 1961-1981)
5. Update `loadStatistics()` to call new method

**Then Test & Commit** (30 minutes):
1. Test statistics display with abbreviated dataset
2. Verify automatic cache invalidation works
3. Commit changes with descriptive message
4. Optional: Update documentation if needed

### Quick Start Commands

**View uncommitted changes**:
```bash
git diff SAAQAnalyzer/SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift
```

**Check current status**:
```bash
git status
```

**When ready to commit**:
```bash
git add SAAQAnalyzer/SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift SAAQAnalyzer/Models/DataModels.swift SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/RegularizationManager.swift
git commit -m "feat: Streamline regularization UI with auto-cache and enhanced statistics"
```
