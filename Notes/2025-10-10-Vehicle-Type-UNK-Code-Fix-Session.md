# Vehicle Type UNK Code Fix - Session Summary

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: Changes ready to commit
**Branch**: `rhoge-dev`

---

## 1. Current Task & Objective

### Primary Goal
Fix the misuse of "AT" (dealer plates) vehicle type code as a placeholder for "Unknown" in the regularization system. Replace it with a proper "UNK" code to match the pattern used for Vehicle Class and Fuel Type unknown values.

### Problem Identified
The regularization UI was using `code: "AT"` for the "Unknown" vehicle type option, which is incorrect because:
- "AT" is a real vehicle type code for dealer plates that exists in the canonical database
- Using "AT" for "Unknown" could cause confusion and data integrity issues
- The correct pattern (already established for Vehicle Class) is to use "UNK" for user-assigned unknown values

### Design Philosophy
**Consistency across enum types**: All "Unknown" enum values should follow the same pattern:
- **Fuel Type**: Code "U" for Unknown (already implemented)
- **Vehicle Class**: Code "UNK" for Unknown (already implemented)
- **Vehicle Type**: Code "UNK" for Unknown (THIS FIX)

---

## 2. Progress Completed

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Database Enum Value Fix
**File**: `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/DatabaseManager.swift` (line 962)

**Before**:
```swift
"INSERT OR IGNORE INTO vehicle_type_enum (code, description) VALUES ('AT', 'Unknown');"
```

**After**:
```swift
"INSERT OR IGNORE INTO vehicle_type_enum (code, description) VALUES ('UNK', 'Unknown');"
```

This change ensures that when the app creates enumeration tables, it inserts the correct "UNK" code for Unknown vehicle type.

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: UI Picker Fix
**File**: `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/RegularizationView.swift` (line 486)

**Before**:
```swift
Text("Unknown").tag(MakeModelHierarchy.VehicleTypeInfo(
    id: -1,  // Placeholder ID - will be looked up from enum table when saving
    code: "AT",
    description: "Unknown",
    recordCount: 0
) as MakeModelHierarchy.VehicleTypeInfo?)
```

**After**:
```swift
Text("Unknown").tag(MakeModelHierarchy.VehicleTypeInfo(
    id: -1,  // Placeholder ID - will be looked up from enum table when saving
    code: "UNK",  // Unknown vehicle type (user-assigned when type cannot be determined)
    description: "Unknown",
    recordCount: 0
) as MakeModelHierarchy.VehicleTypeInfo?)
```

This ensures the UI picker uses the correct code when saving.

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Load Logic Fix
**File**: `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/RegularizationView.swift` (line 1352)

**Before**:
```swift
if vehicleTypeName == "Unknown" {
    selectedVehicleType = MakeModelHierarchy.VehicleTypeInfo(
        id: -1,
        code: "AT",
        description: "Unknown",
        recordCount: 0
    )
```

**After**:
```swift
if vehicleTypeName == "Unknown" {
    selectedVehicleType = MakeModelHierarchy.VehicleTypeInfo(
        id: -1,
        code: "UNK",  // Unknown vehicle type (user-assigned)
        description: "Unknown",
        recordCount: 0
    )
```

This ensures the correct code is used when loading existing "Unknown" vehicle type assignments from the database.

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### Architectural Pattern: Unknown Enum Values

All user-assignable "Unknown" enum values follow this consistent pattern:

| Enum Type | Code | Description | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| Fuel Type | "U" | Unknown | User reviewed and cannot disambiguate fuel type |
| Vehicle Class | "UNK" | Unknown | User reviewed and cannot disambiguate vehicle class |
| Vehicle Type | "UNK" | Unknown | User reviewed and cannot disambiguate vehicle type |

### Database Creation Pattern

The application creates enum tables and populates special values during initialization:

**Location**: `DatabaseManager.createTablesIfNeeded()` (lines 956-963)

```swift
// Insert special "Unknown" values for regularization system
// These values never appear in CSV data but are needed for user-driven regularization
print("üîß Inserting special 'Unknown' enum values for regularization...")
let unknownInserts = [
    "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO fuel_type_enum (code, description) VALUES ('U', 'Unknown');",
    "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO vehicle_class_enum (code, description) VALUES ('UNK', 'Unknown');",
    "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO vehicle_type_enum (code, description) VALUES ('UNK', 'Unknown');"
]
```

**Key Points**:
- `INSERT OR IGNORE` prevents duplicates on re-runs
- These values never appear in source CSV data
- Created specifically for user-driven regularization workflow
- Database is ephemeral - deleted and recreated when container is purged

### UI Placeholder Pattern

The regularization UI uses placeholder ID `-1` for "Unknown" options:

1. **UI displays option** with `id: -1, code: "UNK"`
2. **User selects** "Unknown"
3. **Save logic** detects `id == -1`
4. **Save logic** looks up actual ID from enum table using code "UNK"
5. **Save logic** saves resolved ID to database

This pattern is used for both Vehicle Type and Fuel Type "Unknown" values.

## 6. Next Steps (Priority Order)

### üî¥ IMMEDIATE - Commit Changes

Stage and commit the UNK code fix:

```bash
git add SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/DatabaseManager.swift SAAQAnalyzer/UI/RegularizationView.swift
git commit -m "fix: Use UNK code for Unknown vehicle type instead of AT

Replace misuse of \"AT\" (dealer plates) code with proper \"UNK\" code for
user-assigned unknown vehicle types in regularization system.

Changes:
- DatabaseManager: Insert UNK enum value instead of AT during table creation
- RegularizationView: Use UNK code in UI picker and load logic (2 locations)

This matches the pattern used for:
- Vehicle Class: \"UNK\" for unknown
- Fuel Type: \"U\" for unknown

The AT code should only be used for actual dealer plate vehicles in the
data, not as a placeholder for user-assigned unknown types.

Database recreation required: Delete app container to regenerate tables
with correct enum values.

```

### üü° MEDIUM - Test Database Recreation

1. **Quit SAAQAnalyzer app** (important!)
2. **Delete app container**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.endoquant.SAAQAnalyzer
   ```
3. **Launch app** - database will be recreated with UNK enum value
4. **Verify** that "Unknown" option works in regularization UI
5. **Check database** to confirm UNK value exists:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 ~/Library/Containers/com.endoquant.SAAQAnalyzer/Data/Documents/saaq_data.sqlite \
     "SELECT id, code, description FROM vehicle_type_enum WHERE code IN ('UNK', 'AT');"
   ```
   Expected output: UNK exists, AT may exist if present in imported data

### üü° MEDIUM - Remove Debug Logging

**File**: `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/RegularizationView.swift` (lines 1262-1274)

Remove Honda Civic debug logging added in previous session:
```swift
// DEBUG: Log triplet fuel type status for HONDA/CIVIC
if pair.makeName == "HONDA" && pair.modelName == "CIVIC" {
    print("üîç DEBUG Status Check for HONDA/CIVIC:")
    // ... debug lines ...
}
```

This was added for investigating status badge issues and is no longer needed.

### üü¢ LOW - Push to Remote

After committing and testing:
```bash
git push origin rhoge-dev
```

## 7. Important Context

### Database Recreation Workflow

**User's Development Pattern** (from CLAUDE.md):
- Database is treated as an **ephemeral artifact** for persistence and performance
- When making schema or enum changes, user **purges entire Container**
- App logic regenerates tables with correct structure on next launch
- **No database migrations** - clean slate approach

**Implication**: No need for ALTER TABLE or UPDATE statements. Just fix the INSERT statement and recreate database.

### How This Issue Was Discovered

During review of recent code changes, user noticed that "AT" code was being used for Unknown vehicle type:

**User observation**:
> "It appears that we are using the type code 'AT' as an equivalent to the UNK (Unknown) value added for vehicle class. This is a mis-use of the AT code, as AT is intended for 'dealer plates' that may be mounted on different vehicles depending on need (it seems almost certain that there are some records with type AT in the canonical database)."

**Root cause**: Copy-paste error or incorrect assumption during initial implementation of Unknown vehicle type support.

### Consistency with Existing Patterns

The fix follows the established pattern from Vehicle Class regularization:

**Vehicle Class** (already correct):
- Picker: `code: "UNK"`
- Database: `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO vehicle_class_enum (code, description) VALUES ('UNK', 'Unknown');`

**Fuel Type** (already correct):
- Picker: `code: "U"` (shortened form)
- Database: `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO fuel_type_enum (code, description) VALUES ('U', 'Unknown');`

**Vehicle Type** (NOW fixed):
- Picker: `code: "UNK"` (was "AT", now fixed)
- Database: `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO vehicle_type_enum (code, description) VALUES ('UNK', 'Unknown');`

### Why "UNK" and not "U"

- **Vehicle Class** uses "UNK" (3 characters)
- **Vehicle Type** uses "UNK" (3 characters) - for consistency with Vehicle Class
- **Fuel Type** uses "U" (1 character) - special case, possibly because fuel codes are traditionally single letters (E, D, H, etc.)

### AT Code - Real Meaning

**AT = Dealer Plates** (Auto/Temporary):
- Legitimate vehicle type in SAAQ data
- Used for vehicles with dealer/temporary registration
- Should NOT be overloaded to mean "Unknown"
- Likely exists in canonical database (curated years 2011-2022)

### Save Logic Reference

The save logic in `RegularizationView.saveMapping()` (lines 889-903) handles placeholder ID resolution:

```swift
if let vehicleType = selectedVehicleType, vehicleType.id == -1 {
    print("üîç Resolving placeholder VehicleType ID -1 (code: \(vehicleType.code))")
    let enumManager = CategoricalEnumManager(databaseManager: databaseManager)
    if let resolvedId = try await enumManager.getEnumId(
        table: "vehicle_type_enum",
        column: "code",
        value: vehicleType.code  // Now uses "UNK" instead of "AT"
    ) {
        vehicleTypeId = resolvedId
        print("‚úÖ Resolved VehicleType '\(vehicleType.code)' to ID \(resolvedId)")
    }
}
```

This code doesn't need changes - it already uses the `code` value from the VehicleTypeInfo struct, which now correctly contains "UNK".
