# Regularization UX Bug Fixes - Complete

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Session Type**: Bug Fixes & UX Polish
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Ready to Commit
**Branch**: `rhoge-dev`

---

## Executive Summary

Successful debugging session addressing **6 UX bugs** discovered through user testing of the regularization and "Limit to Curated Years" features. All issues related to inconsistent behavior between UI toggles, filter dropdowns, and query descriptions.

**Key Theme**: **Consistency** - UI state, dropdown options, and query behavior now always aligned.

**Total Issues Fixed**: 6
**Files Modified**: 4
**Lines Changed**: ~80 (mostly logic fixes)
**Documentation Updated**: 1 file

---

## 1. Current Task & Objective

### Overall Goal
Polish the regularization system UX to ensure all components (UI toggles, filter dropdowns, query descriptions, query behavior) stay consistently synchronized.

### Specific Objectives Completed
- ✅ Fix `[Regularized]` tag showing when regularization not applied
- ✅ Filter uncurated entries from dropdowns when "limit to curated years" is ON
- ✅ Make hierarchical filtering respect "limit to curated years" setting
- ✅ Preserve important settings when clearing filters
- ✅ Make year selection buttons respect "limit to curated years" setting
- ✅ Update documentation to reflect bug fixes

---

## 2. Progress Completed

### A. `[Regularized]` Tag Only Shows When Actually Applied (Issue #1)

**Problem**: Query preview and chart legends showed `[Regularized]` even when "Limit to Curated Years" was ON (where regularization doesn't apply to canonical data).

**Scenario**:
1. User toggles "Query Regularization" ON
2. Query description shows `[Regularized]` ✅
3. User then toggles "Limit to Curated Years" ON
4. Description still shows `[Regularized]` ❌ (incorrect - regularization doesn't apply to curated years)

**Root Cause**:
Five locations in `DatabaseManager.swift` checked only `regularizationEnabled` flag, not whether it actually applied to the current query.

**Solution**:
Added `&& !filters.limitToCuratedYears` condition to all tag generation sites:

```swift
// BEFORE
if filters.dataEntityType == .vehicle && optimizedQueryManager?.regularizationEnabled == true {
    metricLabel += " [Regularized]"
}

// AFTER
if filters.dataEntityType == .vehicle && optimizedQueryManager?.regularizationEnabled == true && !filters.limitToCuratedYears {
    metricLabel += " [Regularized]"
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `DatabaseManager.swift:2639` - Aggregate metrics (sum/avg/etc.)
- `DatabaseManager.swift:2674` - Percentage metrics
- `DatabaseManager.swift:2759` - Coverage metrics
- `DatabaseManager.swift:2791` - RWI metrics
- `DatabaseManager.swift:3008` - Count metrics

**Result**: `[Regularized]` tag now only appears when regularization is **actually applied** to the query.

---

### B. Uncurated Entries Filtered from Dropdowns (Issue #2)

**Problem**: Model dropdowns showed entries with `[uncurated:]` tags even when "Limit to Curated Years" was ON, despite those entries never matching any data in curated years.

**Root Cause**:
- `getAvailableMakes()` correctly filtered out `[uncurated:]` entries
- `getAvailableModels()` was missing this display name check (only checked dictionary lookups)

**Solution**:
Added display name filtering to `getAvailableModels()` to match `getAvailableMakes()` behavior:

```swift
if limitToCuratedYears {
    filteredModels = filteredModels.filter { model in
        // Filter out models with uncurated badges (consistent with Makes filtering)
        if model.displayName.contains("[uncurated:") {
            return false
        }

        // Filter out regularization mappings (uncurated variants with arrows)
        if model.displayName.contains(" → ") {
            return false
        }

        // ... rest of filtering logic
    }
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `FilterCacheManager.swift:552-564` - Added display name checks

**Result**: When "Limit to Curated Years" is ON, only canonical options appear in Make and Model dropdowns.

---

### C. Hierarchical Filtering Respects Curated Years (Issue #3)

**Problem**: When user clicked "Filter by Selected Makes" (hierarchical filtering), the early return bypassed "Limit to Curated Years" filtering, showing uncurated models even when the toggle was ON.

**Root Cause**:
Old design decision from October 18 stated: *"Hierarchical filtering BYPASSES 'Limit to Curated Years'"*. This created inconsistency.

**Old Code**:
```swift
// FIRST: Apply hierarchical filtering if requested
if let makeIds = forMakeIds, !makeIds.isEmpty {
    filteredModels = try await filterModelsByMakes(filteredModels, makeIds: makeIds)
    // Skip curated years filtering when hierarchical filtering is active
    return filteredModels  // ← Early return, bypasses curated filter!
}

// SECOND: Apply curated years filter (never reached when hierarchical filtering active)
if limitToCuratedYears {
    // ... filtering code
}
```

**New Code**:
```swift
// FIRST: Apply hierarchical filtering if requested (filter by selected makes)
if let makeIds = forMakeIds, !makeIds.isEmpty {
    filteredModels = try await filterModelsByMakes(filteredModels, makeIds: makeIds)
}

// SECOND: Apply curated years filter if requested
// This applies whether browsing all models or hierarchically filtered models
if limitToCuratedYears {
    // ... filtering code (now always runs when enabled)
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `FilterCacheManager.swift:542-549` - Removed early return, updated comments

**Result**: "Limit to Curated Years" now respected in both browsing and hierarchical filtering modes.

---

### D. Clear Query Preserves Years and Settings (Issue #4)

**Problem**: Clicking "Clear Query" button (X icon next to Execute) reset ALL settings including year selection and "Limit to Curated Years" toggle.

**User Expectation**: Clear filter characteristics (makes, models, regions, etc.) but preserve:
- Year selection (users explore different characteristics within fixed time period)
- Data entity type (vehicles vs. licenses)
- "Limit to Curated Years" toggle (mode setting)

**Solution**:
Modified `clearAllFilters()` to preserve these settings:

```swift
// BEFORE
private func clearAllFilters() {
    let currentDataType = selectedFilters.dataEntityType
    selectedFilters = FilterConfiguration()
    selectedFilters.dataEntityType = currentDataType
}

// AFTER
private func clearAllFilters() {
    let currentDataType = selectedFilters.dataEntityType
    let currentLimitToCuratedYears = selectedFilters.limitToCuratedYears
    let currentYears = selectedFilters.years
    selectedFilters = FilterConfiguration()
    selectedFilters.dataEntityType = currentDataType
    selectedFilters.limitToCuratedYears = currentLimitToCuratedYears
    selectedFilters.years = currentYears
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift:750-758` - Updated clearAllFilters()

**Result**: "Clear Query" now clears only characteristic filters, preserving year selection and mode settings.

---

### E. Year Selection Buttons Respect Curated Years (Issue #5)

**Problem**:
1. When "Limit to Curated Years" was ON, uncurated year toggles correctly grayed out
2. But clicking "All" button selected ALL years including uncurated ones
3. Clicking "Last 5" button also selected uncurated years if they were in the last 5

**Solution**:
Filter year selection through `curatedYears` set when `limitToCuratedYears` is enabled:

```swift
// "All" button
Button("All") {
    if limitToCuratedYears {
        selectedYears = curatedYears.intersection(Set(availableYears))  // Only curated
    } else {
        selectedYears = Set(availableYears)  // All years
    }
}

// "Last 5" button
Button("Last 5") {
    let lastFive = availableYears.suffix(5)
    if limitToCuratedYears {
        selectedYears = Set(lastFive).intersection(curatedYears)  // Filter out uncurated
    } else {
        selectedYears = Set(lastFive)
    }
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `FilterPanel.swift:718-741` - Updated both year selection buttons

**Result**: All year selection methods respect "Limit to Curated Years" setting.

---

### F. Documentation Updated (Issue #6)

**File**: `Documentation/REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md`

**Updates**:
- Clarified that uncurated entries are **always dimmed** (unconditional, not tied to regularization toggle)
- Added section: "When are uncurated/regularization entries shown in dropdowns?"
- Explained hierarchical filtering now respects "Limit to Curated Years"
- Clarified `[Regularized]` tag only appears when regularization actually applied
- Added date annotation: "October 23, 2025 bug fixes"

**Lines Modified**: 19-37

---

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### Pattern 1: Conditional Tag Display Based on Actual Application

**Decision**: Show modifier tags (`[Regularized]`, `[Normalized]`, etc.) only when they actually affect query results.

**Rationale**:
- Tags are not just informational - they indicate query behavior
- Showing `[Regularized]` when regularization doesn't apply is misleading
- Users rely on query descriptions to understand what data they'll get

**Implementation**:
```swift
// Check BOTH conditions:
// 1. Feature is enabled (toggle is ON)
// 2. Feature actually applies to current query (e.g., not overridden by other settings)
if regularizationEnabled && !limitToCuratedYears {
    description += " [Regularized]"
}
```

**Apply To**: All query modifier tags (regularization, normalization, cumulative, etc.)

---

### Pattern 2: Dropdown Options Match Query Behavior

**Decision**: Filter dropdown options to show only values that queries will actually return.

**Rationale**:
- Showing uncurated options when "Limit to Curated Years" is ON confuses users
- Users expect dropdown content to reflect data they'll query
- Reduces cognitive load (no need to remember which options are "fake")

**Implementation**:
```swift
if limitToCuratedYears {
    // Filter out display names with uncurated markers
    filteredItems = items.filter { !$0.displayName.contains("[uncurated:") }
    // Filter out regularization mappings
    filteredItems = filteredItems.filter { !$0.displayName.contains(" → ") }
}
```

**Apply To**: All categorical filter dropdowns (makes, models, fuel types, vehicle types)

---

### Pattern 3: Sequential Filter Application (No Early Returns)

**Decision**: Apply all enabled filters sequentially, don't short-circuit with early returns.

**Bad Pattern** (old code):
```swift
if hierarchicalFilterActive {
    applyHierarchicalFilter()
    return filteredData  // ← Short-circuits, skips other filters!
}

if curatedYearsOnly {
    applyCuratedFilter()
}
```

**Good Pattern** (new code):
```swift
var data = allData

if hierarchicalFilterActive {
    data = applyHierarchicalFilter(data)
}

if curatedYearsOnly {
    data = applyCuratedFilter(data)
}

return data
```

**Rationale**: Filters should compose together, not override each other.

---

### Pattern 4: Preserve User Intent When Clearing

**Decision**: "Clear" operations preserve high-level intent (time period, mode) and reset low-level details (specific characteristics).

**Preserved**:
- Year selection (time period of interest)
- Data entity type (vehicles vs. licenses)
- Mode toggles ("Limit to Curated Years", etc.)

**Cleared**:
- Geographic filters (regions, MRCs, municipalities)
- Vehicle/License characteristics (makes, models, colors, types, etc.)
- Metric configuration (back to default)

**Rationale**: Users typically explore different characteristics within a fixed context, not start completely from scratch.

## 7. Important Context

### Errors Solved This Session

#### Error 1: Regularization Tag Shows Incorrectly
**Symptom**: `[Regularized]` tag in query description even when "Limit to Curated Years" ON
**Root Cause**: Conditional only checked `regularizationEnabled`, not whether it applied
**Solution**: Added `&& !filters.limitToCuratedYears` to all 5 tag generation sites
**Files**: `DatabaseManager.swift` (5 locations)

#### Error 2: Uncurated Models Visible in Curated Mode
**Symptom**: Model dropdown showed `[uncurated:]` entries when shouldn't
**Root Cause**: `getAvailableModels()` missing display name check that `getAvailableMakes()` had
**Solution**: Added display name filtering to match Makes behavior
**Files**: `FilterCacheManager.swift:552-564`

#### Error 3: Hierarchical Filter Bypassed Curated Setting
**Symptom**: Filtering by selected makes showed uncurated models even in curated mode
**Root Cause**: Early return skipped curated years filtering when hierarchical active
**Solution**: Removed early return, let filters apply sequentially
**Files**: `FilterCacheManager.swift:542-549`

#### Error 4: Clear Query Lost User Context
**Symptom**: Clear Query reset year selection and mode toggles
**Root Cause**: Created new `FilterConfiguration()` without preserving key settings
**Solution**: Preserve years, dataEntityType, and limitToCuratedYears
**Files**: `SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift:750-758`

#### Error 5: Year Buttons Ignored Curated Setting
**Symptom**: "All" and "Last 5" selected uncurated years when shouldn't
**Root Cause**: Buttons didn't check `limitToCuratedYears` flag
**Solution**: Filter selection through `curatedYears` set when enabled
**Files**: `FilterPanel.swift:718-741`

#### Error 6: Documentation Outdated
**Symptom**: Docs didn't explain dropdown filtering or tag logic clearly
**Root Cause**: Recent bug fixes changed behavior
**Solution**: Updated REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md with clarifications
**Files**: `Documentation/REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md:19-37`

### Dependencies Added

**None** - All changes use existing frameworks and patterns.

---

### Database Schema Changes

**None** - All changes were UI/logic fixes only.

---

### Performance Characteristics

**No Performance Impact**: All changes are simple conditional checks (O(1) or O(n) filtering).

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Fewer dropdown items when curated mode ON (faster rendering)
- ✅ Clearer query descriptions (better UX)
- ✅ No unnecessary database queries

---

### Testing Results

**Manual Testing** (all passed ✅):

**Test 1: Regularization Tag**
- ✅ Regularization ON, Curated OFF → Shows `[Regularized]`
- ✅ Regularization ON, Curated ON → No `[Regularized]` tag
- ✅ Regularization OFF, Curated OFF → No `[Regularized]` tag
- ✅ Query description and chart legend always match

**Test 2: Dropdown Filtering**
- ✅ Curated OFF → Shows canonical + uncurated + regularization mappings
- ✅ Curated ON → Shows ONLY canonical entries
- ✅ Curated ON + Hierarchical filter → Still only canonical entries

**Test 3: Clear Query**
- ✅ Select years 2011-2015
- ✅ Enable "Limit to Curated Years"
- ✅ Select some makes/models
- ✅ Click Clear Query
- ✅ Years still selected, Curated setting still ON, makes/models cleared

**Test 4: Year Selection Buttons**
- ✅ Curated ON → Uncurated years grayed out
- ✅ Click "All" → Only curated years selected
- ✅ Click "Last 5" → Only curated years in last 5 selected
- ✅ Manual toggle clicks on uncurated years → Disabled (no effect)

**Build Status**:
- ✅ Build: Clean (no warnings)
- ✅ Compiler: Swift 6.2
- ✅ Target: macOS 13.0+
- ✅ Architecture: Universal (arm64 + x86_64)

## 8. Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Check Both Conditions for Conditional Features

**Problem**: Checked if feature was enabled, not if it applied to current context.

**Example**:
```swift
// Wrong: Shows tag when feature enabled
if regularizationEnabled {
    tag = "[Regularized]"
}

// Right: Shows tag when feature enabled AND applicable
if regularizationEnabled && !limitToCuratedYears {
    tag = "[Regularized]"
}
```

**Takeaway**: Features can be enabled but not applicable due to other settings. Check both.

---

### Lesson 2: Dropdown Options Should Match Query Results

**Problem**: Showing options that queries can't return confuses users.

**Solution**: Filter dropdowns based on same conditions as queries.

**Takeaway**: UI should reflect reality - don't show impossible choices.

---

### Lesson 3: Avoid Early Returns in Filter Logic

**Problem**: Early return short-circuits other filters, creating inconsistency.

**Solution**: Apply all enabled filters sequentially.

**Takeaway**: Filters should compose, not override. Use sequential application pattern.

---

### Lesson 4: "Clear" Means Different Things in Different Contexts

**Problem**: Assumed "Clear" meant reset everything to defaults.

**User Expectation**: Clear low-level details, preserve high-level context.

**Solution**: Preserve time period (years) and mode settings, clear characteristics.

**Takeaway**: Think about user workflow - what context do they want to preserve?

### Proposed Commit Message

```
fix: Ensure regularization UI/query consistency with curated years setting

This commit fixes 6 UX bugs related to the interaction between
"Limit to Curated Years" and regularization features:

1. [Regularized] tag now only shows when regularization is actually
   applied (not when limitToCuratedYears overrides it)

2. Uncurated entries filtered from dropdowns when limitToCuratedYears
   is ON (consistent with Makes filtering)

3. Hierarchical filtering (filter by selected makes) now respects
   limitToCuratedYears setting (removed early return)

4. Clear Query button preserves years and limitToCuratedYears setting
   (user intent: clear characteristics, not context)

5. "All" and "Last 5" year buttons respect limitToCuratedYears
   (filter selections through curatedYears set)

6. Documentation updated to reflect bug fixes and clarify behavior

Files modified:
- DatabaseManager.swift: Fix [Regularized] tag logic (5 locations)
- FilterCacheManager.swift: Remove early return, add display filtering
- SAAQAnalyzerApp.swift: Update clearAllFilters() to preserve context
- FilterPanel.swift: Fix year selection button logic
- Documentation/REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md: Clarify dropdown/query behavior
