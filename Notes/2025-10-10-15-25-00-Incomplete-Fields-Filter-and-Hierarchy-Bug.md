# Incomplete Fields Filter Implementation & Hierarchy Bug Discovery

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Filter Implementation Complete, üêõ Hierarchy Bug Identified (Fix Ready)
**Branch**: `rhoge-dev`

---

## 1. Current Task & Objective

### Primary Goal
Enhance the RegularizationView UI with filtering capabilities to help users efficiently manage incomplete regularization mappings.

### Completed Objectives
1. ‚úÖ Enhanced status button tooltips to clarify counts refer to Make/Model pairs
2. ‚úÖ Implemented "Incomplete Fields" filter to target pairs with missing field assignments
3. üêõ Discovered and diagnosed critical bug in canonical hierarchy generation

### Outstanding Issues
- **Critical Bug**: Model years with NULL fuel_type (pre-2017 data) are not included in the canonical hierarchy, preventing users from assigning "Unknown" or reviewing these records in the Regularization Editor

---

## 2. Progress Completed

### A. Enhanced Status Button Tooltips (‚úÖ Complete)
**File**: `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/RegularizationView.swift:1576`

**Change**: Updated tooltip text to clarify that counts refer to Make/Model pairs, not record counts.

```swift
// Before:
.help(isSelected ? "Hide \(label.lowercased()) pairs (\(count) total)" : "Show \(label.lowercased()) pairs (\(count) total)")

// After:
.help(isSelected ? "Hide \(label.lowercased()) Make/Model pairs (\(count) total)" : "Show \(label.lowercased()) Make/Model pairs (\(count) total)")
```

**Purpose**: Eliminate ambiguity between Make/Model pairs and individual vehicle records.

### B. Incomplete Fields Filter (‚úÖ Complete)
**File**: `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/RegularizationView.swift`

**New State Variables** (lines 69-71):
```swift
@State private var filterByIncompleteFields = false
@State private var incompleteVehicleType = false
@State private var incompleteFuelType = false
```

**Filter UI** (lines 301-338):
- Main toggle: "Filter by Incomplete Fields"
- Two checkboxes (appear when toggle is ON):
  - ‚úì Vehicle Type not assigned
  - ‚úì Fuel Type not assigned (any model year)
- Checkboxes use OR logic (show pairs matching either condition)
- Checkboxes automatically reset when main toggle is turned OFF

**Filter Logic** (lines 150-188):
```swift
// Filter by incomplete fields
if filterByIncompleteFields && (incompleteVehicleType || incompleteFuelType) {
    pairs = pairs.filter { pair in
        let mappings = viewModel.getMappingsForPair(pair.makeId, pair.modelId)

        // Skip completely unassigned pairs (no mappings)
        if mappings.isEmpty {
            return false
        }

        let wildcardMapping = mappings.first { $0.modelYearId == nil }
        let tripletMappings = mappings.filter { $0.modelYearId != nil }

        var matchesFilter = false

        // Check Vehicle Type incomplete
        if incompleteVehicleType {
            if let wildcard = wildcardMapping, wildcard.vehicleType == nil {
                matchesFilter = true
            }
        }

        // Check Fuel Type incomplete
        if incompleteFuelType {
            // Show pairs where ANY triplet has NULL fuel type
            if !tripletMappings.isEmpty && tripletMappings.contains(where: { $0.fuelType == nil }) {
                matchesFilter = true
            }
            // Also include pairs with no triplets at all
            else if tripletMappings.isEmpty {
                matchesFilter = true
            }
        }

        return matchesFilter
    }
}
```

**Key Logic**:
- **Vehicle Type filter**: Checks wildcard mapping for NULL vehicle_type
- **Fuel Type filter**: Shows pairs where ANY model year has NULL fuel_type (incomplete assignments)
- Only applies to pairs with existing mappings (ignores completely unassigned pairs)

### C. Bug Discovery: Missing Model Years in Hierarchy

**Problem Identified**: Model years with NULL fuel_type values are not included in the canonical hierarchy.

**Affected Records**: Any Make/Model pairs from curated years 2011-2016 (before fuel_type field was added to SAAQ schema in 2017).

**Example Case**: VOLKS/TOUAR (Volkswagen Touareg)
- Exists in curated years 2012, 2016 with 3 total records
- Has model years: 2010, 2011, 2017
- All records have NULL fuel_type
- Vehicle type: AU (Automobile or Light Truck)
- **Result**: Model years don't appear in Step 4 of Regularization Editor

**Database Evidence**:
```sql
-- VOLKS/TOUAR in curated years (2012, 2016)
VOLKS|TOUAR|2010||Automobile or Light Truck|1
VOLKS|TOUAR|2011||Automobile or Light Truck|1
VOLKS|TOUAR|2017||Automobile or Light Truck|1
```
Note the empty column between model_year and vehicle_type = NULL fuel_type.

**Root Cause Location**: `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/RegularizationManager.swift:181-200`

```swift
// Current code ONLY adds fuel types when all three values are non-NULL:
if let ftId = fuelTypeId, let ftCode = fuelTypeCode, let ftDesc = fuelTypeDesc {
    let fuelTypeInfo = MakeModelHierarchy.FuelTypeInfo(...)

    // Initialize array for this model year if needed
    if makesDict[makeId]!.models[modelId]!.modelYearFuelTypes[modelYearId] == nil {
        makesDict[makeId]!.models[modelId]!.modelYearFuelTypes[modelYearId] = []
    }

    // Add fuel type
    makesDict[makeId]!.models[modelId]!.modelYearFuelTypes[modelYearId]!.append(fuelTypeInfo)
}
```

**Problem**: When fuel_type is NULL, the model year is never initialized in `modelYearFuelTypes`, so it doesn't appear in the hierarchy at all.

**Impact**:
- Users cannot see or assign fuel types to pre-2017 model years
- Auto-regularization creates triplets with NULL fuel_type, but UI can't display them
- "Fuel Type not assigned" filter correctly identifies these pairs, but user can't fix them

---

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### A. Filter Architecture
**Pattern**: Multi-stage filtering with OR logic for flexibility

```swift
var filteredAndSortedPairs: [UnverifiedMakeModelPair] {
    var pairs = viewModel.uncuratedPairs

    // 1. Search text filter
    // 2. Status filter (Unassigned/Needs Review/Complete)
    // 3. Vehicle type filter
    // 4. Incomplete fields filter (NEW)
    // 5. Sort

    return pairs
}
```

**Rationale**: Each filter stage is independent and can be combined with others for powerful targeting.

### B. Incomplete Fields Detection Logic
**Decision**: Use OR logic for checkboxes (match either Vehicle Type OR Fuel Type incomplete).

**Alternative Considered**: AND logic (require both conditions). Rejected because too restrictive - users often want to focus on one dimension at a time.

**Implementation**:
```swift
var matchesFilter = false

if incompleteVehicleType {
    // Check condition 1
    if /* vehicle type is NULL */ {
        matchesFilter = true
    }
}

if incompleteFuelType {
    // Check condition 2
    if /* any fuel type is NULL */ {
        matchesFilter = true
    }
}

return matchesFilter  // True if EITHER condition matched
```

### C. NULL Fuel Type Handling
**Discovery**: Fuel types only exist in SAAQ data from 2017 onward (field added to schema that year).

**Consequence**: Any canonical Make/Model pair with records ONLY from 2011-2016 will have NULL fuel_type for all model years.

**Expected Behavior**: These should still appear in Step 4 with options:
- Not Assigned (default)
- Unknown (user should select this since fuel type cannot be determined from source data)

**Current Behavior**: Model years don't appear at all (bug).

## 6. Next Steps (Priority Order)

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Fix Hierarchy Bug

**File**: `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/RegularizationManager.swift`
**Location**: Lines 181-200 in `generateCanonicalHierarchy()` method

**Required Changes**:

1. **Always initialize model year entries**, even when fuel_type is NULL:

```swift
// After reading row data (around line 168)
let modelYearId: Int? = ...
let modelYear: Int? = ...

// ALWAYS initialize model year array (move outside fuel type conditional)
if let myId = modelYearId {
    // Initialize array for this model year if needed
    if makesDict[makeId]!.models[modelId]!.modelYearFuelTypes[myId] == nil {
        makesDict[makeId]!.models[modelId]!.modelYearFuelTypes[myId] = []
    }
}

// Then add fuel type only if present
if let ftId = fuelTypeId, let ftCode = fuelTypeCode, let ftDesc = fuelTypeDesc {
    let fuelTypeInfo = MakeModelHierarchy.FuelTypeInfo(
        id: ftId,
        code: ftCode,
        description: ftDesc,
        recordCount: recordCount,
        modelYearId: modelYearId,
        modelYear: modelYear
    )

    if let myId = modelYearId {
        makesDict[makeId]!.models[modelId]!.modelYearFuelTypes[myId]!.append(fuelTypeInfo)
    }
}
```

2. **Alternative Approach** (may be cleaner): Use a separate pass to collect all model years first, then populate fuel types.

**Testing After Fix**:
1. Rebuild app
2. Open Regularization Editor
3. Select VOLKS/TOUAR (or any pre-2017 pair)
4. Verify Step 4 shows model years 2010, 2011, 2017
5. Verify each year has options: "Not Assigned" and "Unknown"
6. Assign "Unknown" to all years and save
7. Verify pair moves from "Needs Review" to "Complete" status

### üü° OPTIONAL - Additional Enhancements

1. **Push changes to remote**:
   ```bash
   git push origin rhoge-dev
   ```

2. **Consider CVS integration** (defer to future session):
   - User mentioned Canadian Vehicle Specification database as potential fallback
   - Could provide Make/Model pairs for vehicles introduced after 2022
   - All CVS entries would be AU (passenger vehicles only)
   - This is a separate feature, not related to current bug

3. **Performance optimization** (if needed):
   - Current incomplete fields filter is O(n) for each pair
   - Could cache incomplete status if performance becomes an issue
   - Monitor with large datasets (1000+ pairs)

---

## 7. Important Context

### A. Data Architecture Understanding

**Mapping Structure**:
- **Wildcard mapping** (`model_year_id = NULL`): Stores vehicle_type for entire Make/Model pair
- **Triplet mappings** (`model_year_id` set): Store fuel_type for specific model years
- A complete regularization has: 1 wildcard + N triplets (one per model year)

**Status Logic**:
- üî¥ **Unassigned**: No mappings exist at all
- üü† **Needs Review**: Has wildcard OR some triplets, but not complete
- üü¢ **Complete**: Has vehicle_type in wildcard AND all triplets have assigned fuel_types

**Fuel Type Availability**:
- 2017+ data: fuel_type field populated
- 2011-2016 data: fuel_type is NULL (field didn't exist in SAAQ schema yet)
- This is expected and correct from the data source perspective

### B. Filter Behavior Details

**Incomplete Fields Filter**:
- Only shows pairs with **existing mappings** (ignores completely unassigned pairs)
- This is intentional - the filter helps users complete partially-done work
- For completely new pairs, use the "Unassigned" status filter instead

**Vehicle Type Filter Integration**:
- Can be combined with incomplete fields filter
- Example: "Show AU vehicles with incomplete fuel types"
- All filters work together using AND logic between filter types

### C. UI/UX Notes

**Filter Toggle Visibility**:
- Initial feedback: Toggle was "too subtle" to notice
- Actually matches existing UI patterns (Vehicle Type filter has similar toggle)
- Keeping consistent styling for UI coherence

**Checkbox Behavior**:
- Automatically disabled when main toggle is OFF
- Automatically reset when main toggle is turned OFF
- Prevents invalid state where checkboxes are checked but filter is disabled

### D. Testing Notes

**Test Dataset**: User is working with abbreviated dataset for faster iteration
- Full Quebec dataset is very large
- Abbreviated dataset may be missing some Make/Model pairs
- VOLKS/TOUAR example confirmed present with 3 records in curated years

**Database Location**:
```
~/Library/Containers/com.endoquant.SAAQAnalyzer/Data/Documents/saaq_data.sqlite
```

**Useful Test Queries**:
```sql
-- Check VOLKS/TOUAR records
SELECT
    mk.name as make,
    md.name as model,
    my.year as model_year,
    ft.description as fuel_type,
    vt.description as vehicle_type,
    COUNT(*) as records
FROM vehicles v
JOIN year_enum y ON v.year_id = y.id
JOIN make_enum mk ON v.make_id = mk.id
JOIN model_enum md ON v.model_id = md.id
LEFT JOIN model_year_enum my ON v.model_year_id = my.id
LEFT JOIN fuel_type_enum ft ON v.fuel_type_id = ft.id
LEFT JOIN vehicle_type_enum vt ON v.vehicle_type_id = vt.id
WHERE mk.name = 'VOLKS' AND md.name = 'TOUAR' AND y.year IN (2012, 2016)
GROUP BY mk.name, md.name, my.year, ft.description, vt.description;

-- Check regularization mappings
SELECT
    uc_make.name as uncurated_make,
    uc_model.name as uncurated_model,
    c_make.name as canonical_make,
    c_model.name as canonical_model,
    r.model_year_id,
    vt.description as vehicle_type,
    ft.description as fuel_type
FROM make_model_regularization r
JOIN make_enum uc_make ON r.uncurated_make_id = uc_make.id
JOIN model_enum uc_model ON r.uncurated_model_id = uc_model.id
JOIN make_enum c_make ON r.canonical_make_id = c_make.id
JOIN model_enum c_model ON r.canonical_model_id = c_model.id
LEFT JOIN vehicle_type_enum vt ON r.vehicle_type_id = vt.id
LEFT JOIN fuel_type_enum ft ON r.fuel_type_id = ft.id
WHERE uc_make.name = 'VOLKS' AND uc_model.name = 'TOUAR';
```

### E. Development Patterns

**Swift Version**: 6.2
**Concurrency**: Modern async/await patterns (no DispatchQueue)
**UI Framework**: SwiftUI (avoid AppKit/NS* APIs)
**Database**: SQLite3 with direct C API usage (no wrapper library)

**Code Style**:
- Computed properties for derived state
- @State for view-local state
- @Published for ViewModel observable properties
- Async/await for database operations

### F. Git Workflow

**Branch**: `rhoge-dev`
**Main Branch**: `main`
**Recent Commits**:
- `a9643c6` - feat: Add status counts and vehicle type filtering
- `a741d96` - docs: Update vehicle type documentation
- `f69ffe6` - fix: Use UK code for Unknown vehicle type

## 8. Error History & Solutions

### Issue 1: Filter Not Visible in UI
**Problem**: User couldn't find the new incomplete fields filter in the UI after rebuild.

**Cause**: Filter toggle styling was subtle (gray caption text matching other filters).

**Resolution**: Toggle was correctly implemented and visible - user located it after clarification. No code changes needed.

### Issue 2: Fuel Type Filter Removed All Pairs
**Problem**: Checking "Fuel Type not assigned" removed ALL pairs including Honda Civic with year 2009 showing "Not Assigned".

**Cause**: Original logic showed pairs where ANY triplet has NULL fuel_type. This correctly filtered Honda Civic, but confusion arose because the filter was working as designed - Honda Civic SHOULD appear because it HAS an incomplete fuel type assignment.

**Resolution**: Logic was actually correct. User understood after testing. No changes needed.

### Issue 3: Model Years Not Appearing for VOLKS/TOUAR
**Problem**: VOLKS/TOUAR shows vehicle type AU (auto-assigned) but no model years in Step 4.

**Initial Hypothesis**: CVS (Canadian Vehicle Specification) database integration providing Make/Model pairs without year data.

**Actual Cause**: Canonical hierarchy generation excludes model years with NULL fuel_type (bug in RegularizationManager.swift:181-200).

**Status**: Bug identified and diagnosed. Fix designed but not yet implemented.

## 10. Handoff Checklist

### For Next Session

- [ ] Implement hierarchy bug fix in RegularizationManager.swift
- [ ] Test fix with VOLKS/TOUAR and other pre-2017 pairs
- [ ] Verify "Unknown" can be assigned to NULL fuel_type years
- [ ] Verify status changes from "Needs Review" to "Complete"
- [ ] Commit fix with descriptive message
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Consider push to remote

### Questions to Resolve

1. Should we create a test case specifically for NULL fuel_type model years?
2. Do we want to add a console warning when model years are found without fuel types?
3. Should the UI indicate when "Unknown" is the only valid choice (vs. user discretion)?

### Known Limitations

- Abbreviated test dataset may not be representative of full Quebec data
- Performance not yet tested with 1000+ uncurated pairs
- CVS integration possibility remains unexplored (future enhancement)

**Session End**: October 10, 2025
**Next Task**: Fix canonical hierarchy bug for NULL fuel_type model years
**Estimated Effort**: 15-30 minutes (implement + test)
