---

## 2. Progress Completed

### A. Visual Dimming for Inactive Regularization Mappings ✅

**Problem**: Regularization mappings (with arrows `→`) were shown at full opacity regardless of whether regularization was active, making it unclear whether they would affect queries.

**Solution**: Added 50% opacity dimming for regularization mappings when "Query Regularization" toggle is OFF.

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `SearchableFilterList` component with `dimRegularizationMappings` parameter
- Applied opacity modifier: `.opacity(shouldDim ? 0.5 : 1.0)`
- Connected regularization state through `@AppStorage("regularizationEnabled")`

**Files Modified**:
- `FilterPanel.swift:1256` - Added `dimRegularizationMappings` parameter
- `FilterPanel.swift:1361-1386` - Applied dimming logic to item display
- `FilterPanel.swift:943` - Connected Make filter to dimming
- `FilterPanel.swift:977` - Connected Model filter to dimming
- `FilterPanel.swift:54` - Added `@AppStorage` for regularization state
- `FilterPanel.swift:618-647` - Extracted VehicleFilterSection to avoid type checker error

**Visual Effect**:
- Regularization OFF: Mappings shown at 50% opacity (dimmed)
- Regularization ON: Mappings shown at 100% opacity (bright)
- Applies to both Make and Model filters

---

### B. Contextual Badge Filtering for Curated Years ✅

**Problem**: When "Limit to Curated Years" was ON, regularization mappings (arrows) were still shown in dropdowns, even though they have no relevance in that context.

**Solution**: Filter out regularization mappings entirely when limiting to curated years.

**Implementation**:
- Added `displayName.contains(" → ")` check to curated years filtering
- Ensures only canonical models appear when limiting to curated years

**Files Modified**:
- `FilterCacheManager.swift:567-571` - Added arrow filtering for curated years mode

**Result**: Clean canonical-only view when "Limit to Curated Years" is ON (no badges or variants).

---

### C. Hierarchical Filtering Regression Fix ✅

**Problem**: After previous changes, clicking "Filter by Selected Makes" caused the model section to disappear (showing 0 models).

**Root Cause**: Accidentally applied curated years filtering AFTER hierarchical filtering, violating the design principle from October 18 that hierarchical filtering should bypass other filters.

**Solution**: Early return after hierarchical filtering to bypass curated years filter.

**Files Modified**:
- `FilterCacheManager.swift:545-549` - Added early return for hierarchical filtering

**Design Principle Restored**: "When user clicks 'Filter by Selected Makes', they want ALL models for that make" - hierarchical filtering shows everything, regardless of curated years toggle.

---

### D. FilterCacheManager Invalidation After Mapping Updates ✅

**Problem**: When users saved regularization mappings during a session, badge displays wouldn't update until app restart.

**Root Cause**: Queries read `make_model_regularization` table directly (not cached), but badge display relies on `FilterCacheManager.regularizationInfo` in-memory cache.

**Solution**: Invalidate `FilterCacheManager` immediately after saving mappings.

**Implementation**:
- Added `filterCacheManager?.invalidateCache()` after manual mapping saves
- Added same invalidation after auto-regularization completes
- Wrapped in `await MainActor.run { }` for Swift 6 concurrency compliance

**Files Modified**:
- `RegularizationView.swift:1558-1563` - Manual save invalidation
- `RegularizationView.swift:1797-1801` - Auto-regularization invalidation

**Impact**:
- ✅ Query performance NOT affected (queries read database directly)
- ✅ Badge displays update immediately (next dropdown open)
- ✅ No app restart required

**Console Messages**:
```
✅ Invalidated uncurated pairs cache after batch save
✅ Invalidated filter cache for badge updates
```

---

### E. Search Auto-Expand for Better Discovery ✅

**Problem**: When searching "nova" in Make filter with many uncurated variants, the canonical "NOVA" option wasn't visible in the default 5-item preview. Clicking "Show All" manually wasn't always desirable due to UI lag with thousands of entries.

**Solution**: Automatically expand search results when they're small enough to display without lag.

**Implementation**:
- Auto-expand when search returns ≤20 items (small enough for no lag)
- Auto-expand when search narrows results to ≤30% of original list (significant filtering)
- Hide "Show All" button when auto-expanded (cleaner UI)

**Files Modified**:
- `FilterPanel.swift:1279-1289` - Added auto-expand logic
- `FilterPanel.swift:1340-1356` - Updated button visibility logic

**User Experience**:
- Search "nova" → Auto-expands to show canonical NOVA + variants
- Search "a" → Doesn't auto-expand (too many results)
- Search specific model → Auto-expands if results reasonable

---

### F. ART (NOVA) Model Filtering Fixes ✅

**Problem**: Multiple issues with ART (NOVA) model:
1. Returned zero records with regularization OFF (should return non-zero)
2. Incorrectly filtered out when "Limit to Curated Years" was ON (exists in curated years)
3. Uncurated models appearing in dropdowns when limiting to curated years

**Root Cause**: FilterCacheManager was filtering out ANY model with regularization mappings, even if it existed in curated years.

**Solution**: Only filter out models in `uncuratedPairs` dictionary (exist ONLY in uncurated years), not models with `regularizationInfo` (which just indicates mappings exist).

**Files Modified**:
- `FilterCacheManager.swift:561-575` - Fixed curated years filtering logic
- `OptimizedQueryManager.swift:183,203` - Respect `limitToCuratedYears` flag when loading models

**Key Insight**: A model can exist in curated years AND have regularization mappings (for uncurated variants in 2023-2024).

---

### G. Make/Model ID Expansion Restoration ✅

**Problem**: After removing Vehicle Type ID expansion, Make/Model regularization stopped working entirely (no expansion happening).

**Root Cause**: Make/Model are required fields (NOT NULL), so they need ID expansion to work. Unlike Vehicle Type/Fuel Type which use EXISTS subqueries for NULL values.

**Solution**: Restored Make/Model ID expansion with proper conditionals:
- Only expand when `regularizationEnabled == true`
- AND when `limitToCuratedYears == false`

**Files Modified**:
- `OptimizedQueryManager.swift:217-245` - Restored expansion with conditionals

**Result**: Regularization now works correctly for Make/Model filters when enabled.

---

### H. Swift 6 Concurrency Warning Fix ✅

**Problem**: Build warning about accessing MainActor-isolated properties from async context.

**Solution**: Wrapped `invalidateCache()` calls in `await MainActor.run { }` blocks.

**Files Modified**:
- `RegularizationView.swift:1560-1563` - Manual save
- `RegularizationView.swift:1798-1801` - Auto-regularization

**Result**: Clean build with no concurrency warnings.

---

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### Pattern 1: Badge Display Philosophy - Informational vs Operational

**Decision**: Badges show what mappings EXIST, not whether they're ACTIVE.

**Rationale**:
- Users can see what mappings are available
- Users know what will happen if they turn regularization ON
- Provides transparency about data quality issues

**Exception**: When "Limit to Curated Years" is ON, hide regularization badges entirely (not relevant in that context).

### Pattern 2: Visual Feedback for Inactive State

**Decision**: Use 50% opacity dimming for inactive regularization mappings.

**Rationale**:
- Clear visual distinction between active/inactive states
- Non-intrusive (mappings still visible and selectable)
- Consistent with common UI patterns (disabled controls are dimmed)

### Pattern 3: Search Auto-Expand Thresholds

**Decision**: Auto-expand when ≤20 items OR ≤30% of original list size.

**Rationale**:
- 20 items: Small enough to display without noticeable lag
- 30% filtering: Significant narrowing suggests user knows what they want
- Prevents hiding canonical options behind "Show All" button

### Pattern 4: Hierarchical Filtering Overrides Curated Years Filter

**Decision**: "Filter by Selected Makes" shows ALL models for selected makes, regardless of curated years toggle.

**Rationale**:
- User's explicit intent to see everything for that make
- Consistent with design from October 18
- Prevents confusing behavior where models disappear

### Pattern 5: Immediate Cache Invalidation After Updates

**Decision**: Invalidate filter cache immediately after saving/auto-regularizing mappings.

**Rationale**:
- Queries aren't affected (read database directly)
- Badge displays update seamlessly
- No app restart confusion
- Better developer/user experience

## 7. Important Context

### Errors Solved This Session

#### Error 1: Type Checker Timeout (FilterPanel.swift:53)
**Symptom**: "The compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time"
**Root Cause**: VehicleFilterSection initialization too complex for Swift type checker
**Solution**: Extracted to computed property `vehicleCharacteristicsDisclosureGroup`
**Location**: FilterPanel.swift:618-647

#### Error 2: Swift 6 Concurrency Warning (RegularizationView.swift:1796)
**Symptom**: "Expression is 'async' but is not marked with 'await'"
**Root Cause**: Accessing MainActor-isolated properties from async Task context
**Solution**: Wrapped in `await MainActor.run { }`
**Locations**: RegularizationView.swift:1560-1563, 1798-1801

#### Error 3: Model Section Disappearing
**Symptom**: Clicking "Filter by Selected Makes" showed 0 models
**Root Cause**: Applied curated years filtering after hierarchical filtering
**Solution**: Early return after hierarchical filtering
**Location**: FilterCacheManager.swift:545-549

#### Error 4: ART (NOVA) Incorrectly Filtered
**Symptom**: ART (NOVA) didn't appear when limiting to curated years
**Root Cause**: Filtered out ANY model with regularization mappings
**Solution**: Only filter out models in `uncuratedPairs` dictionary
**Location**: FilterCacheManager.swift:561-575
