# Percentage Metric Numerator Dropdown Debug Session
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - All issues fixed and tested

## Current Task & Objective

**Primary Goal**: Fix "Invalid percentage configuration" error when using the "Percentage in Superset" metric in License mode.

**User Report**: When selecting MRC=Montreal + Type=APPRENTI and choosing "Percentage in Superset" with "License Type" as the numerator category, the query fails with:
```
❌ Error creating chart series: queryFailed("Invalid percentage configuration")
```

## Progress Completed

### 1. Fixed Missing License Filter Categories (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: The "Numerator Category" dropdown was missing license-specific filter categories.

**Files Modified**:
- `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/FilterPanel.swift`

**Changes Made**:
1. **Added missing categories to `FilterCategory` enum** (lines 1781-1803):
   - `licenseTypes = "License Type"`
   - `ageGroups = "Age Group"`
   - `genders = "Gender"`
   - `experienceLevels = "Experience Level"`
   - `licenseClasses = "License Classes"`
   - Also added missing vehicle category: `vehicleColors = "Vehicle Color"`

2. **Updated `availableCategories` computed property** (lines 1805-1836):
   - Added checks for all 5 license-specific filters
   - Added check for `vehicleColors`
   - Organized into three sections: Geographic (shared), Vehicle-specific, License-specific

3. **Updated `createBaselineFilters()` function** (lines 2062-2103):
   - Added switch cases for all 5 license-specific filters
   - Added case for `vehicleColors`

**Result**: The "Numerator Category" dropdown now correctly shows all available filter categories including license-specific ones.

### 2. Added Debug Logging (COMPLETED)
**Purpose**: Track the state of `percentageBaseFilters` through selection and query execution.

**Files Modified**:
1. `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/FilterPanel.swift` (lines 1904-1924)
2. `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/DatabaseManager.swift` (lines 1823-1833)

**Debug Output Expected**:
- When selecting category: "🔍 Percentage category selected: [category]"
- When creating baseline: "✅ Created percentageBaseFilters, dropping category: [category]"
- When query runs: "🔍 percentageBaseFilters is nil: [true/false]"

## Key Decisions & Patterns

### Filter Category Architecture
The percentage metric works by:
1. User selects filters (e.g., MRC=Montreal, Type=APPRENTI)
2. User chooses which filter category to use as numerator (e.g., "License Type")
3. System creates baseline by removing that category from filters
4. Query calculates: (numerator count) / (baseline count) × 100

### Binding Pattern
The UI uses a custom `Binding` with get/set closures:
```swift
Binding(
    get: { selectedCategoryToRemove },
    set: { newCategory in
        selectedCategoryToRemove = newCategory
        if let category = newCategory {
            percentageBaseFilters = createBaselineFilters(droppingCategory: category)
        } else {
            percentageBaseFilters = nil
        }
    }
)
```

## Current State

### Issue Status: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
**All Issues**: ✅ RESOLVED - Tested and working correctly

**Root Causes Identified and Fixed**:
1. ✅ **RESOLVED**: Missing license-specific filter categories in percentage dropdown
2. ✅ **RESOLVED**: SwiftUI view lifecycle issue where `@State` variable was not restored when view was recreated
3. ✅ **RESOLVED**: Percentage metric queries route through legacy string-based query path that uses old column names (`mrc` instead of `mrc_id`)

**Problem**:
- `MetricConfigurationSection` uses a `@State private var selectedCategoryToRemove`
- When SwiftUI recreates the view (common during navigation/tab switches), this `@State` variable resets to `nil`
- Even though `percentageBaseFilters` binding was correctly updated in the parent, the UI showed "Select category..." because the local state was lost

**Solution Implemented**:
Added `.onAppear` handler with `syncCategorySelectionFromBaseFilters()` function that:
1. Checks if `percentageBaseFilters` exists in parent configuration
2. Compares current filters with baseline filters to determine which category was removed
3. Restores `selectedCategoryToRemove` to match the existing configuration
4. Ensures UI state is consistent with data model on every view load

### Debug Logging Retained
The code continues to print:
- **On selection**: Category name and baseline filter details
- **On sync**: Category restored from base filters
- **On query**: Metric type and whether `percentageBaseFilters` is nil

## Implementation Details

### 3. State Synchronization Fix (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: View recreation causes local `@State` to reset, breaking UI-data consistency.

**Files Modified**:
- `SAAQAnalyzer/UI/FilterPanel.swift`

**Changes Made**:
1. **Added `.onAppear` handler** (lines 1871-1875):
   - Calls `syncCategorySelectionFromBaseFilters()` when view loads
   - Ensures state is restored from parent configuration

2. **Implemented `syncCategorySelectionFromBaseFilters()` function** (lines 2118-2167):
   - Compares `currentFilters` with `percentageBaseFilters` to detect which category is missing
   - Checks all 16 filter types (geographic, vehicle, license)
   - Restores `selectedCategoryToRemove` to match existing configuration
   - Logs sync action for debugging

**Key Logic**:
```swift
// If a category is non-empty in current but empty in baseline, that's the removed category
if !currentFilters.licenseTypes.isEmpty && baseFilters.licenseTypes.isEmpty {
    selectedCategoryToRemove = .licenseTypes
}
```

**Result**: UI state now persists across view lifecycles, maintaining consistency with data model.

### 4. Query Routing Fix for Percentage Metrics (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: Percentage queries bypass optimized integer-based query manager and use legacy string-based queries.

**Files Modified**:
- `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/DatabaseManager.swift`

**Changes Made**:
Updated `queryDataRaw()` function (lines 1886-1908) to:
1. Check if optimized query manager is available (`useOptimizedQueries`)
2. Route through `queryOptimizedVehicleData()` or `queryOptimizedLicenseData()`
3. Extract `.points` from the FilteredDataSeries result
4. Fall back to legacy queries only if optimized path unavailable

**Before**:
```swift
private func queryDataRaw(filters: FilterConfiguration) async throws -> [TimeSeriesPoint] {
    switch filters.dataEntityType {
    case .vehicle:
        return try await queryVehicleDataRaw(filters: filters)  // ❌ Always uses legacy
    case .license:
        return try await queryLicenseDataRaw(filters: filters)  // ❌ Uses wrong column names
    }
}
```

**After**:
```swift
private func queryDataRaw(filters: FilterConfiguration) async throws -> [TimeSeriesPoint] {
    if useOptimizedQueries, let optimizedManager = optimizedQueryManager {
        // ✅ Use optimized integer-based queries (mrc_id, admin_region_id, etc.)
        let series = try await optimizedManager.queryOptimizedLicenseData(filters: filters)
        return series.points
    }
    // Fall back to legacy only if needed
}
```

**Result**: Percentage queries now use correct database schema with integer-based foreign keys.

## Testing & Validation

### Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User selects filters (e.g., MRC=Montreal, Type=APPRENTI)
2. User chooses "Percentage in Superset" metric
3. User selects "License Type" from numerator dropdown
4. Dropdown shows "License Type" (not "Select category...")
5. Query executes successfully
6. Chart displays percentage of APPRENTI holders within all holders in Montreal

### Console Output to Verify
When loading a saved configuration:
```
🔄 Synced category selection from base filters: License Type
```

When selecting a new category:
```
🔍 Percentage category selected: License Type
✅ Created percentageBaseFilters, dropping category: License Type
   Baseline has 0 license types, 1 MRCs
```

When query runs successfully:
```
🔢 calculatePercentagePointsParallel() called
🔍 Metric type: percentage
🔍 percentageBaseFilters is nil: false
```

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### ✅ TESTING COMPLETED (2025-10-16)

**Test Scenario**: License mode, MRC=Montreal + Type=APPRENTI, Percentage metric, License Type numerator

**Results**:
- ✅ Dropdown correctly shows "License Type" after selection
- ✅ State persists across view lifecycles
- ✅ Queries use optimized integer-based path (`mrc_id`, `license_type_id`)
- ✅ Parallel queries complete successfully (3.002s for 12 years of data)
- ✅ Percentage calculations accurate (4.59% in 2011 → 6.37% in 2021 → 5.78% in 2022)

**Console Output Excerpt**:
```
⚡ Parallel percentage queries completed in 3.002s (12 numerator, 12 baseline points)
Year 2021: numerator=73012, baseline=1146756, percentage=6.37%
```

### CLEANUP COMPLETED (2025-10-16)
1. ✅ Removed excessive debug logging from percentage metric code
2. ✅ Converted remaining logging to AppLogger (performance, query warnings)
3. ✅ Kept essential performance metrics for monitoring
4. ✅ Updated documentation to reflect resolved status

## Important Context

### Architecture Details
- **Three-panel layout**: FilterPanel (left) → ChartView (center) → DataInspector (right)
- **FilterConfiguration**: Main model passed via `@Binding` from `ContentView` to `FilterPanel`
- **MetricConfigurationSection**: Child view that receives `@Binding var percentageBaseFilters`
- **State flow**: User action → `selectedCategoryToRemove` → `percentageBaseFilters` binding → parent `FilterConfiguration`

### Previous Similar Issue (RESOLVED)
On 2025-10-14, there was a similar issue with the percentage metric where `vehicleTypes` wasn't included. This was fixed by adding the missing category. The current issue is different - the categories ARE showing, but the binding isn't persisting.

### Testing Context
- **Mode**: License mode
- **Filters**: MRC=Montreal, Type=APPRENTI
- **Metric**: Percentage in Superset
- **Selected Category**: License Type (confirmed via screenshot)
- **Expected Behavior**: Calculate percentage of APPRENTI license holders within all license holders in Montreal

### Error Message Evolution
- **Original**: "Invalid percentage configuration"
- **Enhanced** (after debug logging): "Invalid percentage configuration: Please select a Numerator Category from the dropdown"

### SwiftUI Binding Gotchas
1. **Custom bindings** with get/set closures can have timing issues
2. **@State** variables in child views might not sync with parent @Binding
3. **Picker** changes might not trigger immediately if wrapped in complex binding logic
4. **View recreation** can reset @State variables

## Code References

### Key Function: createBaselineFilters()
**Location**: `FilterPanel.swift:2062-2103`

Creates a copy of current filters with one category removed:
```swift
private func createBaselineFilters(droppingCategory: FilterCategory) -> PercentageBaseFilters {
    var baseFilters = PercentageBaseFilters.from(currentFilters)

    switch droppingCategory {
    case .licenseTypes:
        baseFilters.licenseTypes.removeAll()
    // ... other cases
    }

    return baseFilters
}
```

### Key Validation: calculatePercentagePointsParallel()
**Location**: `DatabaseManager.swift:1827-1833`

Validates percentage configuration before querying:
```swift
guard filters.metricType == .percentage,
      let baselineFilters = filters.percentageBaseFilters else {
    throw DatabaseError.queryFailed("Invalid percentage configuration...")
}
```

## Dependencies & Configuration

### No New Dependencies Added
All changes use existing SwiftUI and Foundation APIs.

### Build Status
- No compiler errors
- No new warnings introduced
- Debug logging uses standard `print()` statements

## Session Continuity Notes

### If Debug Logging Reveals Root Cause
The next session should:
1. Review console output provided by user
2. Implement appropriate fix based on findings
3. Test the fix with same scenario (MRC + License Type percentage)
4. Remove debug logging once issue is resolved
5. Update CLAUDE.md if architectural changes are needed

### If Issue Persists
Consider:
1. Adding more granular logging at binding update points
2. Checking if `MetricConfigurationSection` view is being recreated
3. Investigating SwiftUI view lifecycle with percentage metric
4. Testing with simpler binding approach (direct @State in parent)

### Success Criteria
- User can select License Type as numerator category
- Query executes without "Invalid percentage configuration" error
- Percentage calculation returns valid results
- Same functionality works for all filter category types (vehicle and license)
