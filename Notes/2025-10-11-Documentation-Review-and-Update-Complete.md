## 1. Current Task & Objective

### Overall Goal
Conduct a comprehensive review of all markdown documentation files in the `Documentation/` directory to ensure they accurately reflect the current feature set, workflows, and architectural decisions, with special attention to features added in October 2025.

### Problem Statement
Documentation can become stale across multiple development sessions, especially when context window limitations require multiple sessions for complex features. Need to verify that:
- All October 2025 features are properly documented
- Workflow guides are accurate and current
- Users are directed to production-ready approaches (not experimental ones)
- Test coverage requirements are documented
- No outdated information misleads users or future developers

### Solution Approach
Systematic review of each documentation file against:
1. Recent commit history (October 2025 commits)
2. Current codebase state (CLAUDE.md, README.md)
3. Implementation completeness (code vs. documentation)
4. User guidance accuracy (production vs. experimental approaches)

---

## 2. Progress Completed

### A. Documentation Review (All Files) ✅

Conducted comprehensive review of all 15 markdown files in `Documentation/` directory:

**Files Reviewed and Found Accurate:**
1. ✅ **Vehicle-Registration-Schema.md** - Complete schema documentation, all fields documented, 2017 fuel type cutoff properly noted
2. ✅ **CSV-Normalization-Guide.md** - Comprehensive NormalizeCSV.swift guide, encoding fixes, geographic lookups
3. ✅ **REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md** - Extremely well-maintained, covers all recent features including:
   - Triplet-based fuel type filtering
   - Canonical hierarchy cache (109x speedup)
   - Badge system and status filters
   - Cardinal type auto-assignment
   - Model year assignment UI
4. ✅ **LOGGING_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Up to date (last updated Oct 11, 2025), documents completed migrations and pending work
5. ✅ **Driver-License-Schema.md** - Reference documentation (not changed)
6. ✅ **Architecture Documents** - Swift comparisons, macOS analysis, AppKit analysis (historical reference, no updates needed)

**Files Updated This Session:**
1. ✏️ **TEST_SUITE.md** - Added October 2025 features section (see below)
2. ✏️ **Make-Model-Standardization-Workflow.md** - Added experimental warning (see below)

### B. TEST_SUITE.md Updates ✅

**File**: `Documentation/TEST_SUITE.md`

**Changes Made** (lines 280-339):
- Added comprehensive "Pending Test Coverage (October 2025 Features)" section
- Documented test requirements for **Road Wear Index (RWI)**:
  - Calculation correctness (4th power law: damage ∝ axle_load^4)
  - Vehicle-type-aware weight distribution (AU, CA, AB vehicles)
  - Normalization toggle (normalize to first year = 1.0)
  - Average vs Sum modes
  - Raw vs Normalized display formats
  - Provided specific test method names: `testRoadWearIndexCalculation()`, `testRoadWearIndexWeightDistribution()`, etc.

- Documented test requirements for **Cumulative Sum Transform**:
  - Running total calculation verification
  - Transformation order (normalize → cumulative)
  - Works with all metric types (Count, RWI, Average, Percentage, Coverage)
  - Vehicle and license data paths
  - Provided test method names: `testCumulativeSumCalculation()`, `testCumulativeSumWithNormalization()`, etc.

- Documented test requirements for **Regularization System Performance**:
  - Canonical hierarchy cache (109x speedup verification)
  - Background auto-regularization
  - Database indexes on enum table IDs
  - Triplet-based fuel type filtering
  - Provided test method names: `testCanonicalHierarchyCachePerformance()`, `testBackgroundAutoRegularization()`, etc.

- Updated "Future Test Considerations":
  - Added RWI vehicle type edge cases
  - Added Data Package export with canonical cache

**Rationale**: October 2025 features (RWI, Cumulative Sum, Regularization Performance) have no test coverage yet. Documentation now provides clear guidance for future test implementation.

### C. Make-Model-Standardization-Workflow.md Updates ✅

**File**: `Documentation/Make-Model-Standardization-Workflow.md`

**Changes Made** (lines 3-14):
- Added prominent warning box at top of document
- Clearly labels approach as "EXPERIMENTAL - NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION"
- Directs users to production-ready **Regularization System** (REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md)
- Lists advantages of regularization system:
  - User-controlled mappings via UI
  - Reversible corrections (doesn't modify source data)
  - Fuel type and vehicle type disambiguation
  - Query-time regularization with toggle control
  - Canonical hierarchy cache for performance
- Preserves document for research purposes while preventing production misuse

**Rationale**: This document describes string-similarity-based CSV correction approach that is experimental and not recommended for production. CLAUDE.md notes this as "EXPERIMENTAL - DO NOT apply to production database". Warning prevents users from applying this approach when the Regularization System is the correct production workflow.

### D. Git Commits ✅

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### Decision 1: Comprehensive Documentation Review Approach

**Rationale**: Documentation accuracy is critical for:
- User guidance (production vs. experimental approaches)
- Future development (test coverage requirements)
- Onboarding (new developers understanding current state)
- Context window efficiency (accurate docs reduce questions/confusion)

**Approach Taken**:
1. Review commit history (October 2025) to identify recent features
2. Cross-reference with CLAUDE.md and README.md
3. Check each documentation file for accuracy
4. Update files that are outdated or incomplete
5. Add warnings where needed (experimental approaches)

**Result**: All 15 documentation files reviewed, 2 updated, rest confirmed accurate.

### Decision 2: Document Test Coverage Gaps (Don't Implement)

**Rationale**: October 2025 features (RWI, Cumulative Sum) lack test coverage, but:
- Implementing tests is a separate, substantial task
- Documentation should note the gap for future work
- Provides clear guidance on what tests are needed
- Test method names provided for consistency

**Approach**: Added "Pending Test Coverage" section to TEST_SUITE.md with:
- Feature descriptions
- Specific test requirements
- Suggested test method names
- Implementation notes

**Trade-off**: Tests not implemented yet, but documentation provides clear roadmap.

### Decision 3: Experimental Warning Strategy

**Rationale**: Make-Model-Standardization-Workflow.md describes an approach that:
- Is labeled "EXPERIMENTAL" in CLAUDE.md
- Modifies source CSV files (irreversible)
- Lacks fuel type / vehicle type disambiguation
- Is superseded by Regularization System

**Approach**: Add prominent warning box at document top:
- Clear "NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION" label
- Points to production alternative (Regularization System)
- Lists advantages of production approach
- Preserves document for research/historical purposes

**Result**: Users won't accidentally apply experimental approach to production data.

**Commits Since Last Push** (2 total):
1. `b0192c7` - feat: Add cumulative sum toggle for all chart metrics (previous session)
2. `c2ae021` - docs: Update documentation to reflect October 2025 features and workflows (this session)

**Local State**:
- Branch is **2 commits ahead** of `origin/rhoge-dev`
- Working tree: **clean**
- Ready to push with: `git push`

---

## 6. Next Steps (Priority Order)

### IMMEDIATE: Push Commits to Remote

Both cumulative sum feature and documentation updates are committed locally but not pushed:

```bash
git push
```

This will push:
1. Cumulative sum feature implementation (commit `b0192c7`)
2. Documentation updates (commit `c2ae021`)

### SHORT-TERM: Test October 2025 Features with Real Data

Since all code and documentation is committed, validate implementation with user testing:

**Test Scenarios** (refer to TEST_SUITE.md for details):
1. **Road Wear Index**:
   - Test calculation with different vehicle types (AU, CA, AB)
   - Toggle normalization on/off, verify values
   - Switch between Average and Sum modes
   - Compare raw vs. normalized display

2. **Cumulative Sum**:
   - Enable cumulative sum for Count metric (growing fleet)
   - Enable cumulative sum for RWI with normalization
   - Test with different metric types
   - Verify transformation order (normalize → cumulative)

3. **Regularization System**:
   - Verify canonical hierarchy cache performance
   - Test background auto-regularization
   - Validate triplet-based fuel type filtering
   - Check database index usage (no table scans)

### MEDIUM-TERM: Implement Test Coverage

Following the guidance in TEST_SUITE.md (lines 280-339), implement tests for:

**Priority 1: Road Wear Index**
```swift
// In DatabaseManagerTests.swift or new RoadWearIndexTests.swift
testRoadWearIndexCalculation()           // Verify 4th power law math
testRoadWearIndexWeightDistribution()    // Test AU/CA/AB weight splits
testRoadWearIndexNormalization()         // Verify normalization to year 1
testRoadWearIndexModes()                 // Test Average vs Sum modes
```

**Priority 2: Cumulative Sum Transform**
```swift
// In DatabaseManagerTests.swift
testCumulativeSumCalculation()           // Verify running total logic
testCumulativeSumWithNormalization()     // Test RWI normalize → cumulative order
testCumulativeSumAllMetrics()            // Test with Count, Average, Percentage, etc.
testCumulativeSumLicenseData()           // Test license data path
```

**Priority 3: Regularization Performance**
```swift
// In new RegularizationPerformanceTests.swift
testCanonicalHierarchyCachePerformance() // Verify 109x improvement
testBackgroundAutoRegularization()       // Test async processing
testRegularizationIndexes()              // Verify JOIN performance
testTripletFuelTypeFiltering()           // Test Make/Model/Year matching
```

### LONG-TERM: Continue Logging Migration

**Current Status** (from LOGGING_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md):
- 5/7 core files migrated to os.Logger
- **Pending**: DatabaseManager.swift (~138 print statements)

**Approach**:
1. Review LOGGING_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md patterns
2. Migrate DatabaseManager.swift in phases (complex file)
3. Update LOGGING_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md when complete

5. **Logging Migration** (Oct 9-11) - 5/7 core files migrated

### Documentation Quality Assessment

**Well-Maintained Documents** (no issues found):
- `REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md` - Exceptional quality, covers all features comprehensively
- `LOGGING_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Up to date with migration status
- `CSV-Normalization-Guide.md` - Comprehensive guide with examples
- `Vehicle-Registration-Schema.md` - Complete schema reference

**Updated This Session**:
- `TEST_SUITE.md` - Now documents October 2025 feature test requirements
- `Make-Model-Standardization-Workflow.md` - Now has clear experimental warning

**No Issues Found**:
- Architecture/reference documents (historical context, accurate)
- Schema documentation (complete and accurate)

### Key Architectural Patterns (Relevant to Documentation)

**Dual Query Path Pattern**:
- Traditional path: DatabaseManager (string-based queries)
- Optimized path: OptimizedQueryManager (integer-based queries)
- Both paths implement same transformations (normalization, cumulative sum)
- Documentation reflects this in CLAUDE.md

**Transformation Pipeline Pattern**:
- Order matters: Query → Normalize (if enabled) → Cumulative Sum (if enabled) → Display
- Documented in CLAUDE.md lines 193-211 (Cumulative Sum section)
- Test requirements reflect this in TEST_SUITE.md

**Production vs. Experimental Workflows**:
- **Production**: Regularization System (UI-based, reversible, query-time)
- **Experimental**: String-similarity CSV correction (irreversible, pre-import)
- Documentation now clearly distinguishes these approaches

### Gotchas Discovered

**None** - This was a documentation-only session with no code changes.

**Documentation Review Insights**:
1. Most documentation was already well-maintained (especially REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md)
2. Test coverage gap for October 2025 features was expected (features just implemented)
3. Experimental workflow warning was needed to prevent production misuse
4. Architecture/reference documents don't need frequent updates (historical context)

### Dependencies

**No New Dependencies**: Documentation-only session.

**Existing Documentation Dependencies**:
- TEST_SUITE.md → References CLAUDE.md for project guidance
- Make-Model-Standardization-Workflow.md → Now references REGULARIZATION_BEHAVIOR.md for production approach
- All documentation → Cross-references Vehicle-Registration-Schema.md for data definitions
