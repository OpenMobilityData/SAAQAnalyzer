# Canonical Hierarchy Cache Optimization - Session Handoff

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Branch**: `rhoge-dev`
**Project**: SAAQAnalyzer
**Session Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Optimization implemented, tested, documented, and committed

---

## 1. Current Task & Objective

### Overall Goal
Optimize the slow regularization query performance that was blocking the UI for unacceptable durations (13-146 seconds).

### Specific Objective
Implement a materialized cache table to pre-aggregate canonical Make/Model/Year/Fuel/VehicleType combinations, eliminating expensive 6-way JOINs on millions of vehicle records.

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Reduce canonical hierarchy generation time from 13s to <1s
- ✅ Cache persists across app sessions (no rebuild needed)
- ✅ Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- ✅ Zero changes to UI or user-facing behavior

---

## 2. Progress Completed

### Implementation (100% Complete)

**Database Schema:**
- ✅ Created `canonical_hierarchy_cache` table in DatabaseManager.swift
  - Schema: make_id, make_name, model_id, model_name, model_year_id, model_year, fuel_type_id, fuel_type_code, fuel_type_description, vehicle_type_id, vehicle_type_code, vehicle_type_description, record_count
  - Primary key: (make_id, model_id, model_year_id, fuel_type_id, vehicle_type_id)
  - Indexes: idx_cache_make_id, idx_cache_model_id, idx_cache_make_model

**Cache Management:**
- ✅ Added `isCanonicalHierarchyCacheEmpty()` to detect if population is needed
- ✅ Added `populateCanonicalHierarchyCache(curatedYears: [Int])` to populate from curated years
- ✅ Cache population performs single INSERT...SELECT with GROUP BY
- ✅ Automatic cache detection and population on first use

**Query Optimization:**
- ✅ Rewrote `RegularizationManager.generateCanonicalHierarchy()` to:
  1. Check if cache is empty
  2. Populate cache if needed (one-time ~14s cost)
  3. Query cache table directly (no JOINs, no GROUP BY)
  4. Return same data structure for backward compatibility

**Swift 6 Compliance:**
- ✅ Added `import OSLog` to DatabaseManager for AppLogger support
- ✅ Fixed concurrency warnings with proper capture lists `[db]` in async closures

### Testing (100% Complete)

**Montreal Dataset (10M records):**
- ✅ Baseline measured: 13.435s for canonical hierarchy generation
- ✅ First run (cache population): 14.608s (includes population + first query)
- ✅ Second run (using cache): 0.123s ⚡
- ✅ **Performance improvement: 109x faster**

**Console Output Analysis:**
- ✅ Baseline captured: `~/tmp/regulurization_console.txt`
- ✅ Optimized run captured: `~/tmp/regulurization_console2.txt`
- ✅ Verified cache messages appear correctly
- ✅ Confirmed cache persists across view close/reopen

### Documentation (100% Complete)

**CLAUDE.md Updates:**
- ✅ Added canonical_hierarchy_cache to Database Schema section
- ✅ Documented performance benchmarks (13.4s → 0.12s, 109x improvement)
- ✅ Updated Performance Optimizations section with cache details

**Git Commit:**
- ✅ All changes staged and committed
- ✅ Commit: `9b10da9 perf: Implement canonical hierarchy cache for 109x query performance improvement`
- ✅ Comprehensive commit message with problem/solution/results
- ✅ Branch `rhoge-dev` is 2 commits ahead of origin

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

### Architecture Decisions

**1. Materialized Cache Approach**
- **Decision**: Pre-aggregate data into cache table rather than optimize query structure
- **Rationale**: Eliminates fundamental bottleneck (6-way JOINs + GROUP BY on millions of rows)
- **Trade-off**: One-time population cost (~14s) vs. persistent sub-second queries

**2. On-Demand Population**
- **Decision**: Populate cache on first query, not during import
- **Rationale**: Simpler implementation, no changes to CSV import flow
- **Pattern**: Check if empty → populate if needed → query cache

**3. Cache Persistence Strategy**
- **Decision**: Store in database, no rebuild needed across sessions
- **Rationale**: Curated years don't change frequently (static 2011-2022 data)
- **Invalidation**: Manual only (delete cache if curated year configuration changes)

**4. Backward Compatibility**
- **Decision**: Keep same output data structure from generateCanonicalHierarchy()
- **Rationale**: Zero changes needed to calling code or UI
- **Pattern**: Cache query returns identical structure to original JOIN query

### Code Patterns Established

**Swift 6 Async Concurrency:**
```swift
// Pattern for database access in async closures
return await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
    dbQueue.async { [db] in  // ← Explicit capture list required
        // ... database operations with db
    }
}
```

**Cache Check Pattern:**
```swift
// Check cache before expensive operation
let cacheEmpty = await dbManager.isCanonicalHierarchyCacheEmpty()
if cacheEmpty {
    logger.info("Cache is empty, populating...")
    try await dbManager.populateCanonicalHierarchyCache(curatedYears: curatedYearsList)
}
```

**Logging Pattern:**
```swift
// Always use AppLogger for production logging
AppLogger.database.info("Message with \(interpolation)")
AppLogger.database.notice("Important event")  // Default level
```

## 6. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions: NONE REQUIRED ✅

This optimization is **complete and production-ready**. The regularization system now performs at acceptable speeds for production use.

### Optional Future Enhancements (Low Priority)

**1. Cache Invalidation Strategy (Future)**
- Currently: Cache persists indefinitely (curated years are static 2011-2022)
- Enhancement: Add "Clear Cache" button in Settings if curated year configuration changes
- Priority: Low (curated years rarely change)

**2. Full Dataset Testing (Optional)**
- Current: Tested with Montreal subset (10M records)
- Optional: Test with full 77M record dataset to confirm projected ~1.3s performance
- Priority: Low (Montreal results are sufficient proof of concept)

**3. Cache Statistics (Nice-to-Have)**
- Enhancement: Display cache row count and last population date in Settings
- Pattern: Similar to regularization statistics display
- Priority: Very Low (informational only, not critical)

### If Returning to This Area

**To verify cache is working:**
```bash
# Check cache row count
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/SAAQAnalyzer/saaq_data.sqlite \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM canonical_hierarchy_cache;"

# Check cache sample data
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/SAAQAnalyzer/saaq_data.sqlite \
  "SELECT make_name, model_name, COUNT(*) FROM canonical_hierarchy_cache
   GROUP BY make_name, model_name LIMIT 10;"
```

**To clear cache for testing:**
```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/SAAQAnalyzer/saaq_data.sqlite \
  "DELETE FROM canonical_hierarchy_cache;"
```

## 7. Important Context

### Problem Analysis (From Previous Session)

**Root Cause Identified:**
- `RegularizationManager.generateCanonicalHierarchy()` performed 6-way JOINs
- Query structure: vehicles → year_enum → make_enum → model_enum → model_year_enum → fuel_type_enum → vehicle_type_enum
- GROUP BY on 5 columns: mk.id, md.id, my.id, ft.id, vt.id
- Scanned millions of vehicle records to produce thousands of unique combinations

**Why Indexes Didn't Help:**
- All proper indexes existed and were being used
- Bottleneck was query structure, not missing indexes
- No amount of indexing can eliminate the cost of scanning 10M+ rows and grouping

### Solution Implemented

**Materialized Cache Strategy:**
1. Pre-aggregate canonical combinations once into cache table
2. Cache contains only thousands of rows (vs millions in vehicles)
3. Simple SELECT from cache (no JOINs, no GROUP BY)
4. Result: 109x performance improvement

**Key Implementation Details:**

**Cache Population Query:**
```sql
INSERT INTO canonical_hierarchy_cache (...)
SELECT mk.id, mk.name, md.id, md.name, my.id, my.year,
       ft.id, ft.code, ft.description, vt.id, vt.code, vt.description,
       COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM vehicles v
JOIN year_enum y ON v.year_id = y.id
JOIN make_enum mk ON v.make_id = mk.id
-- ... (other JOINs)
WHERE y.year IN (2011, 2012, ..., 2022)  -- curated years
GROUP BY mk.id, md.id, my.id, ft.id, vt.id;
```

**Cache Query (Fast):**
```sql
SELECT make_id, make_name, model_id, model_name, ...
FROM canonical_hierarchy_cache
ORDER BY make_name, model_name, model_year, fuel_type_description, vehicle_type_code;
```

### Errors Solved

**1. Missing OSLog Import**
```
Error: Instance method 'info' is not available due to missing import of defining module 'os'
Solution: Added `import OSLog` to DatabaseManager.swift
```

**2. Swift 6 Concurrency Warnings**
```
Error: Capture of 'db' with non-Sendable type 'OpaquePointer' in a '@Sendable' closure
Solution: Added explicit capture list: `dbQueue.async { [db] in ... }`
```

**3. Build System Warning (Non-blocking)**
```
Warning: The Copy Bundle Resources build phase contains this target's Info.plist file
Status: Pre-existing warning, unrelated to our changes, can be ignored
```

### Performance Baselines Preserved

**Montreal Dataset (10M records):**
- Baseline: 13.435s (canonical hierarchy generation)
- Optimized: 0.123s (cache query)
- Improvement: 109x faster

**Full Dataset (77M records) - Projected:**
- Baseline: 146.675s (2.4 minutes)
- Projected: ~1.3s (based on improvement ratio)
- Note: Not tested with full dataset, Montreal results sufficient

### Testing Methodology

**Test Environment:**
- Dataset: Montreal subset (municipality code 66023)
- Years imported: 2011-2024 (14 years)
- Record count: ~10M vehicle records
- Curated years: 2011-2022 (12 years for canonical hierarchy)
- Uncurated years: 2023-2024 (2 years)

**Test Procedure:**
1. Run app with fresh database (no cache)
2. Open RegularizationView (triggers cache population)
3. Record console output to `~/tmp/regulurization_console2.txt`
4. Close and reopen RegularizationView
5. Verify second load is fast (<1s)

**Console Messages to Confirm Success:**
```
First run:
  Canonical hierarchy cache is empty, populating...
  Generated base canonical hierarchy: 343 makes, 7511 models in 14.608s

Second run:
  Generated base canonical hierarchy: 343 makes, 7511 models in 0.123s
```

### Dependencies & Requirements

**No New Dependencies:**
- Uses existing SQLite3 (built-in macOS)
- Uses existing OSLog (Apple's unified logging)
- No external packages added

**Minimum Requirements:**
- macOS 13.0+ (for NavigationSplitView)
- Swift 6.2 (for modern concurrency)
- Xcode 15+ (for Swift 6 support)

### Known Gotchas

**1. Cache Invalidation**
- Cache does NOT automatically rebuild if curated year configuration changes
- Manual intervention needed: Delete cache rows or drop table
- Future enhancement: Add cache clearing to Settings

**2. First Load Performance**
- First query after cache clear will be slower (~14.6s for Montreal)
- This is expected: includes cache population + first query
- Subsequent queries are fast (0.12s)

**3. Console Logging**
- Cache population success message may not appear in Xcode console
- This is harmless: async logging race condition in closure
- Cache still populates correctly (verified by second query performance)

## Quick Start for Next Session

If you need to continue work in this area:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/rhoge/Desktop/SAAQAnalyzer

# Check git status
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Verify cache is working
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/SAAQAnalyzer/saaq_data.sqlite \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM canonical_hierarchy_cache;"

# Open in Xcode to test
open SAAQAnalyzer.xcodeproj
```

**Key Files to Reference:**
- `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/DatabaseManager.swift` - Cache management
- `SAAQAnalyzer/DataLayer/RegularizationManager.swift` - Cache usage
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project documentation
- `Notes/2025-10-11-Claude-Code-Recovery-doc.md` - Previous session context

**To Test Performance:**
1. Open app in Xcode
2. Navigate to Regularization view
3. Watch Xcode console for timing messages
4. Look for: "Generated base canonical hierarchy: X makes, Y models in Z.ZZZs"
5. Close and reopen view - should be <1 second

---

## Summary

✅ **Mission Accomplished**: Canonical hierarchy cache optimization is complete, tested, documented, and committed. The regularization system is now production-ready with 109x performance improvement (13.4s → 0.12s).

**Key Achievement**: Eliminated UI-blocking delays in regularization workflow through materialized cache architecture.

**Status**: No further action required. System is stable and performing as expected.
